I have impplemented my solr-client in php using the solr-php-client provided in assignment description.
My php file is named as try.php
I added AND parameter in additional parameter for both lucene and pagerank. That can be found in try.php
My try.php was in my solr 7.2.1/solr-php-client folder, so in screenshot you can see the path as http://localhost:8180/solr-php-client/try.php 

Hope I added required information..
