The person was driving in the vicinity of the Cordova Airport, when the witness reports observing a &quot;clump of fog&quot; jumping across the roadway in front of the car.  The witness&apos;s attention is immediately drawn to the event, although concludes that it must just have been fog being swept over the roadway.  A few seconds later, witness sees the same event, but the &quot;object&quot; is now closer, and more visible.  The circling event occurs a total of six times, and is concluded when a strange looking object is hovering over the right-front fender of the witness&apos;s car.  The witness proceeds to drive many more miles toward the town of Cordova, when the witness becomes aware of two large, disc-shaped objects sitting in a meadow beside the roadway.  The witness calls the next morning, and is quite emotionally upset by the experience.  Reports that the event was quite dramatic.

It was virtually motionless in the sky, except when it was to seen to rotate horizontally.  It had a red and blue light on the ventral side, and there were either 3 or 4 strange lights on what was taken to be the trailing edge of the craft.  Observed for 2 or 3 minutes.

19961217	19961218	Sunrise, FL	sphere	60-90 seconds	SUMMARY:  We saw a comet like shape heading west to east very fast, Suddenly the comet tail dissapeared, than ignited twice then disapeared.On tuesday Dec 17 at 9:00pm my friend and I were on our way home from the sawgrass mills mall. In Sunrise Fl. The highway that we were on runs north and south.To the west is all Everglades, to the east is Sunrise, Up in the sky way way west we saw a comet shaped object moving west to east in an arc shaped motion.It looked like a blueish sphere with a reddish comet-like tail.It was way too high to see any real detail. The object was moving at an incredable rate of speed. Suddenly the comet tail went out and all you could see was the blue orb. When the UFO was over the road (still way to high to see detail) the tail&quot;fired&quot; twice, like some kind ofafte rburners.And was rocketed out of sight to the east ina matter of seconds, way faster than anything either of us had ever seen. My friend and I know alot about airplanes and this fits no description we could make. Planes appear to be moving slowly from afar, not this thing.We have absoultly no explanation for this.It !must have traveled 50 or 60 miles in the extent of 60 to 90 seconds.Please post this so I can find out if anyone else saw it. There were plenty of other cars on the road at this time.

19961120	19961204	North Port, FL		8 min.	A man was outside his home for a last smoke and to walk his dog, before going to bed. He looked at the night sky to the southwest, because that is the direction where there is no treeline, and he suddenly noticed a light, which at first he thought might be a star, although it appeared to him to be rather large to be a star. When he looked back at a a couple of minutes later, it was now larger than a full moon!  Also, it appeared to be getting closer to him, and was lower to the horizon, he thought.  Then he realized that it had become two distinct lights, both bright white.  At this point, he summoned his wife, who also saw the object as it passed directly overhead.  they both agreed it was less that 500 feet above them. It was not a helicopter, and it was too slow for an aircraft.  The two lights were on the bottom, and they were glowing.  They could see an outline of the object as it passed overhead, and it appeared to be &quot;pie-shaped.&quot; They both heard a really low hum as the object passed overhead very slowly.  The object suddenly disappeared approximately 2 seconds after it had passed overhead.  The caller added that he and his wife have three cats, one of which is an &quot;outside&quot; cat, and two that are &quot;indoor&quot; cats.  After the incident, all of the them were gone, and they did not return until approximately one week later. Their dog, which normally is very eager to go outside, would not go outside for several days without coaxing from his owner.  The dog, a pit bull (?) was apparently very upset for several days afterward.  At 2315 hrs. that night, after the sighting, the dog started barking and snapping at the front door, and he would not go through that door for 4-5 days.

19961115	19961123	Blossburg, PA		30 sec.	The caller, a senior member of the military (ret./artillery), together with another observer, had witnessed a very peculiar sight in the night sky to the north of his location. The observer was located approximately 20 miles south of the NY/PA state line10 miles south of Mansfield, and 6 miles south of the intersection of U.S. Routes #15 and #6. He saw what appeared to be a commercial airliner, with normal navigation lights, flying from the northern sky to the southeast with a round, bright orange ball of light about &quot;200 mils&quot; (approx 7 degrees arc) in front of the aircraft!  The object was approximately &quot;10 mils&quot; (approx. 20 arc minutes) in diameter.The type of aircraft he witnessed was unknown to him, but he felt certain it was a commercial type a/c.  It had &quot;blue and red lights&quot; (sic) on it. He commented that the crew of the aircraft MUST have seen the object, which he thought was probably directly ahead of the aircraft.  The object was NOT a meteor, the observer reported.  It was moving across the sky in a methodical fashion, at a seemingly steady pace.  It was certainly not streaking.   Neither object made any noise, which struck the observer as being very strange. He did not hear any jet noise whatever, even though the object passed directly overhead of his position.

He was standing outside to look for the comet, when he noticed a V-shaped formation of points of light almost directly overhead.  Eadh &quot;wing&quot; of the &quot;V&quot; consisted of approximately 10 objects, each about the size of a small star.  Each side of the &quot;V&quot; was swept about 10 degrees behind the straight line oriented perpendicular to the line of flight of the formation. The formation had a very high angular velocity, and the observers estimate was that they were moving at a very high speed.  He stated that they looked like a formation of jet fighters, but there was no sound.  The formation was moving faster than a formation of fighters would have been moving.  The observer watched them pass through approximately 15 degrees of arc, moving from west to east--toward the lights of Houston to the east of his position--when they disappeared from his sight because of the brightness of the ambient light.

It had one flashing red light above the spotlight and two white lights to each side of the object (4 total). Then another light appeared out of nowhere behind the first one. This one looked to be the same as the other. We quickly sped away in the car to his house about 500 meters away. When we got out of the car the first one was still directly above us as if it backed up to follow us. The object made no sound at all, even though it was so low to the ground.It was dark out. It was in a residential area so there were houses and trees around. The object was rather large (bigger than any plane around here) We saw two of them, one was REALLY close the other was about 100 meters behind the other. Both of them were hovering. They were both dark in color, either black or gray. The &quot;spotlights&quot; were very bright.

19961107	19961207	Seattle, WA	sphere	7 sec.	SUMMARY:  Dimly lit group of colored objects hovering over the Woodland Park Zoo emitting light beams similar to spotlights.I was walking my dogs with a friend in the park adjacent to the zoo; it was a lull in the heavy rain.  We walked into a parking lot to use the tunnel on the way home.   As we emerged from the trees my friend pointed upwards.  Just above the zoo, 400 yards from the parking lot were the four shapes in the sky:  two faint blue spheres moving back and forth like in vibration as a pair.  Closer to us was a cylindrical object the same width of the spheres, and length three times the diameter (1x3), emitting a rose colored tint.  The closest object was a larger sphere emitting a deep maroon glow.  The three (four) objects hovered back and forth independently, while their lights seemed to engulf them and be focused towards the ground at the same time.  After a few second of looking at these objects and being in awe the purple sphere became bright to the point neither of us could look any longer and were forced to look down.  When I looked up again there was nothing.  My friend then saw nothing. My dogs did not seem to notice anything.

His impression was that the objects were perhaps 1 or 2 miles from him, and perhaps 1/4 mile above ground level, and maybe 200 yards from one another. (He saw a commercial jet in the distance, apparently leaving Baltimore airport or Andrews AFB, so he had something to compare with the objects he was observing.)The color of the objects was that of pencil lead, perhaps with a bit of copper-colored tinge to them.  They were generally round, but they were slightly out of round at the equator.The object just moved  out of sight rapidly, in approximately one second!  They just STREAKED.Caller called Laurel, MD, police, but they said it was a matter for Arundel Co. sheriff&apos;s office.  Sheriff&apos;s office said it was a matter for the state police.

But the flight of the objects was unlike that of birds--there were no wings on it, nothing was flapping, and the flight was very smooth. His father had seen something very similar about a week earlier, he thought on 06JN96. The two objects parted, rose in altitude, veered together, then disappeared.

19970206	19970212	Coober Pedy, S.A. (Approx. 250km south of) (Australia),	light		SUMMARY:  A stormy night on the Stuart Highway. Sighting of a UFO which appeared to land,  a UFO chasing the car some 50m behind, and the sighting of a man which was extremely unusual looking.The first event to happen was the sighting of a &apos;roadwork&apos; man sweeping the highway.  Whilst driving along the highway, an extremely bright light suddenly appeared in front of us. At first we thought it was a truck coming towards us - common on the highway-but as we drove towards it we realised it was a stationary truck with a bright light attatched to the front of the grill. Upon getting closer to the light, it was that bright and blinding that we had to slow down to 10kms just to see the road and where we were going. Half the road was closed and suddenly we were able to see a man. There he was sweeping the road at 21:30(approx) 200kms from the nearest roadhouse. We slowly drove up to him to explain that we could not see the road due to the light and essentialy could not see him. We now believe that not being able to see him was what he wanted. The man hardly showed his face and what we did see - he had an extremely high forehead and very wide set eyes. He was approx. 7 fee!t tall and of stocky build. He did not want us talking to him and made every attempt to get us to move on quickly. As we drove off the light slowly disappeared - which is what got us thinking. Due to the cloud cover that night, a light of that intensity would have cast quite a bit of glare i.e. we would have seen the light from quite a distance, however the light suddenly flashed on and we were not descending or ascending a hill! My questions at the time were who was he, what was he doing that far out of town at that time of night and what was he sweeping off the road?Eventually that passed as we drove along the highway again.Approximately 30mins after this happened an extremely bright light came up from behind us - we had not passed a car since the roadwork man - to within 50m of us. It followed  our car for about 4 seconds before disappearing. The lights intensity was similar to that of a cars high-beam headlights and was orange-yellow in colour. Neither of us said anything - we were starting to get spooked.As we were driving up the road we were heading into a storm. As we got closer to the storm I was checking the stars to see where the storm cloud started - it was that black that there was a definite black line where the storm cloud startes. As I was watching the stars I noticed an extremely orange star. As I continued watching it moved forward so it kept up with the car, not falling behind like the other stars were. From where we were this &apos;star&apos; was about 5-6mm across. As I continued watching the light moved on a diagonal path towards the horizon and was now in front of the car. This light continued downwards until it reached a point slightly above the horizon, if not on the horizon, and that is where it stayed until the blackness of the strom blocked my view.Among these happenings we passed a military style vehicle with no insignia which was cruising up the highway rather slowly. We could not see the driver as we passed the vehicle.The storm that we drove through was extremely active for about 2 hours until we actually reached it. (there had been continuous lightning for these two hours). Yet as soon as the light was blocked out by the clouds all lightning stopped. As far as we know a storm does not just stop suddenly.As we neared Coober Pedy, a white 4WD suddenly pulled out from the side of the road and forced our car to slow down considerably. In the back window of this car two shapes could be seen moving and I can tell you with all honesty that they did not look like dogs or humans or any other animal but I did not get a very good look at them so I cannot accurately say or judge what they were.We eventually made it to Coober Pedy and were relieved to see other humans.The whole event really spooked both me and my fiance and we have vowed never to travel on the highway agein at night. (the highway runs directly from Adelaide to Alice Springs and continues to Darwin, passing through townships and roadhouses.It passes through some of the most lonely land in Australia).As we checked out of our motel the next morning we metioned these events to the receptionist who just smiled and said oh well you wouldn&apos;t be the first to talk about things like that. That was all we could get out of her,she wouldn&apos;t talk anymore.For my fiance, it is the second time that he has witnessed events of a &apos;supernatural&apos; kind - he is in his late twenties. I have witnessed other happenings including metallic cigar shaped objects and other orange lights resembling stars but moving otherwise to indicate that they were not a star. I am 18.I am not providing my address as yet for security reasons - as well as I only connected to the net yesterday and haven&apos;t bothered yet to set up an e-mail address on my computer. I will watch this site for further information.I have provided this report because I know how hard it is to gain information on these matters. As well as in the interests of &apos;science&apos;.I hope you make some use of this report.				0	4	7.7	403014	0.0000193	alien_abduction	0.001768868	0.037098609

Suddenly, the wife, who was in the passenger&apos;s seat, observed a large, bright, white light in the left portion of the windshield.  It was much brighter than a helicopter light, and had a steady glow to it.  At first, she said nothing to her husband, but when it disappeared from her sight behind some cypress trees, and then was visible again after their car had passed them, she realized the object was probably not an aircraft, and it was not a reflection off a side window. Suddenly, the object developed a green or blue tail, and it accelerated very rapidly, disappearing from their sight.   The object was moving generally from the southwest to the northwest.

19871220	19970119	Las Vegas (60-70 miles north-east of, Interstate 15 North), NV	light	3 - 4 minutes	SUMMARY:  Viewed pairs of red strobing lights extended across wide area of Nevada desert and watched as two F-15 fighter aircraft tried to intercept light formation.On December 20, 1989 I and two co-workers were on our way to Aspen,CO. We were driving a 24Ft. rental truck loaded with items for our employer&apos;s winter home.We were approximately 60-70 miles north-east of Las Vegas when we heard cargo in the rear of the truck shift. I pulled over to check the cargo and found everything secure. We all took this opportunity to stretch our legs and while facing away from the highway and looking in a southerly direction,I noticed six pairs of strobing red lights. They were located on a east-west plane and seemed to be evenly spaced. A large mountain stood in the distance andI later learned that it was Virgin Peak. What caught my attention readily was the very slow strob speed of the lights. I looked for other color patterns and none were visable. It is almost impossible for me to determine distance or height of objects, and no shape patterns were visable due to impending sunset.There was no noticable noise at the onset of sighting. After viewing objects for approximtely 2-3 minutes we noticed the sound of jet aircraft. Suddenly from a north-west direction two F-15 fighters flew over at a tremendous rate of speed. I would estimate that they were flying at approximately 500 feet and as they passed the ground reverberated with the sonic boom. We all watched in awe as the pairs of red strobbing lights moved tremendously fast to the east and suddenly in unison changed course to the south-east and raised altitude until they vanished. This all took place within a matter of seconds, and the pursuing fighters had no chance what so ever to catch these objects. This was truly a hair-raising experience for all of us and we did not waste any time in exiting the area.				0	0	1.1	0	0.00000879	alien_abduction	0.001091703	0.020036749

Approximately 1-3 seconds later, a third &quot;star&quot; joined the first two, such that now all three of them are moving to the east in a triangular formation, with the apex of the triangle trailing the other two, which were abreast in the lead.  The observer moved the binoculars from his eyes, blinked, and looked at the formation of three objects a second time, both with his eyes, and with the use of binoculars again.  Suddenly, the three objects started moving from the west to the south, and appeared to the observer that they started to gain altitude.  Then, the two objects in the lead suddenly disappeared, and the object in back stopped, and reversed its direction of travel to the north.					3	6.9	430055	0.0000182	alien_abduction	0.008576329	0.012752647

The approach of 2 1/2&apos; to 3&apos; tall beings.At about 21:00, while on a camping trip in the Poudre Canyon area, lights were witnessed flying around some trees. Then, later, at about 02:00 more lights appeared, and a large group of lights overhead. This is when the whooshing sound was heard. The two men of the group were retrieving water when this occurred. The two women were witnessing this phenomenon when the guys came back. The lights landed nearby, behind some trees. The smaller balls of lights were &quot;whirling&quot; around the nearby trees.Shortly after 02:00 these small beings approached the camp site. I was extremely terrorized by this. They approached, then backed off, then approached, and backed off. This occurred numerous times. Their approach was from about 300 to 500 feet from us, and were plainly visible to the group.The smaller balls of light, put a &quot;box&quot; or something resembling a box in a tree, aroung 04:00 to 05:00 in the morning.The small being continued to &quot;terrorize&quot; the group until about 06:00 in the morning.

19960131	19970121	Buckhead Ridge, FL	light	5 min 30 sec	SUMMARY:  I observed an object apparently making a controlled reentry or entry into the atmosphere.  It was the size of a medium sized star and  fairly far away.The object caught my attention by leaving a bright yellow and orange trail down toward earth at about an attitude of 40 degrees above the horizon which lasted for about 20-30 seconds before it disappeared from the highest point of origin to the lowest.  It was round and tiny like a medium magnitude star and appeared at the time of the orange trail&apos;s disappearance and proceeded to move about directly East and perfectly parallel to the horizon, not appearing to lose any altitude at all.  I noted the time at the initial observation and it travelled eastward for 5 minutes before it disappeared over some high cirrus or haze.It appeared to be NNW of me,  perhaps over Orlando around a hundred miles away.I checked and there were no shuttles up that night.  I am a private pilot, a scientist and a weather spotter, with a degrees in Psychology and Education as well as having been recognized by Who&apos;s Who for outstanding career achievement.

The light, a solid, non-blinking one, appeared to be coming over the trees, and the observer estimated it to be at 5,000 feet in altitude, or less.He called NORAD at Cheyenne Mountain; finally got our number from Comox AFB in Canada.  The same night, he observed approximately six satellites, which provided him with a comparison with what he had seen.  The caller was still audibly excited about his sighting at the time of his call.   Suddenly, the &quot;thing&quot; just accelerated very fast, going from an estimated 150 mph, to 800 mph, to 1,500 mph.

At first, he thought it might be a (daytime) meteor, but it was distinctly white against a blue sky.  The object traveled from directly overhead to the horizon, traveling west to east, in approximately 3-4 seconds.  Its angular velocity was much higher than the space shuttle when it returns from orbit, which the caller had seen on many occasions.The object traveled across the sky at a seemingly constant rate, although it changed direction suddenly on at least two occasions toward the end of the observation, when it was close to the horizon.He had another sighting together with five carloads of young people in 1976.  It was a huge object, and very close to the ground, he thought.	MeadWestvaco Heliport	45.37104618	843638	2.186357979	3	6.9	430055	0.0000182	alien_abduction	0.008576329	0.012752647

19950915	19970221	Wasilla, AK	light	10:00	SUMMARY:  Noticed two objects traveling in an erratic manner in a southerly direction out of the North-East.Person A.&amp;B were walking down a dirt road traveling South-West.Person A. about ten feet back from Person B got the feeling of being watched,turned abrubtly. Person B noticed and turned as well. Both persons witnessed an orange light about ten finger-widths above the horizon. The object was moving in an erratic manner, with signifigant altitude changes every second.The object then started to move in a southerly direction and dissapeared behind a treeline near the horizon. Both persons, after discussing the object turned and continued walking in a SW direction. After an unspecified amount of time (less than ten minutes, we believe) Person B also felt as if he was being watched. At that point he turned and witnessed a second orange light. traveling about in the same course &amp;the same erratic manner.In further detail of the odd behavior that was observed of the two objects;they were both moving EXTREMELY slowly across the sky, with rapid peaks and descents in their altitude. They would jump in altitude(at least one finger width)and then dop in altitude (at least one finger width) within a seconds time.

19960227	19960301	Saginaw, MI	light	8 min.	A pilot and his 1st officer in a Beechcraft 1900 with passengers, while flying at 16,000 feet between layers of solid overcast 90 miles southeast of Saginaw, MI, suddenly see a large, bizarre ball of light appear in front of them.  They both thought it was another aircraft and were concerned that it might collide with them, so they turned on their identification lights and initiated a turn.  The object apparently was capable of &quot;jumping&quot; suddenly, perhaps as much as 20 or 30 miles within 1 second time.  The crew requested clearance to descend, which they did.  they descended to 9500 feet, but the object appeared to descend with them, staying on their now, &quot;12:00&quot; position.  They continued their descent to 3,500 feet, where they entered the clouds. Another airliner, a Northwest commuter (Callsign: &quot;Masaba&quot;) witnessed the interaction.  Multiple conversations occured with Cleveland Center and Saginaw Approach about the incident. The crew borrowed a still camera from one of the passengers, and attempted to photograph the object.  The camera and film were returned to the passenger after the photograph had been taken. Copy of radio communication requested 04MR96 under FOIA.

Three male adults were driving south on Highway 98, which crosses &quot;3 Mile Bridge.&quot;  To the east of them, they saw a bright yellow light, that appeared to expand outward, like a &quot;runway light, or a tracer (round).&quot;Then, they saw something be shot out of the first object, and this process continued until a number of other items had been ejected from the first object.  These secondary objects would disappear, then reappear, as the first object slowly was moving away from the observers&apos; location.  It moved farther out to sea, such that it was about 10 degrees above the horizon.  At this point, the primary object appeared to the observers to release one object, which moved to the left, and another object, which appeared to move to the right.  Shortly thereafter, all three object appeared to be expelling lights, &quot;or something.&quot; The observers stopped their car to watch the process as it continued.

It was dark out but the lights from the school lit up the playground.  Corn fields were on 3 sides of the school and a street to the other.  We were sitting and talk when suddenly the silence behind us stoped.  We herd a soft humming like the sound the comes from one of those green power boxes (the big ones with the large hinges)   Then a large triangular shaped object came from behind us (to the south).  It was about 100 ft.off the ground.  It had yellow flashing lights on each point.  It stayed above us for about 2-3 mins then rapidly accelarated back to the south over a mountain.

Woman called to report that she had been driving west on an east-west runninbg highway with her daughter (age 9 yrs.), when they both noticed an &quot;aircraft&quot; with 3x blinking lights on it, located about 1 mile east of the town of Clatonia.  The light on the &quot;south part&quot; of the craft was blue, the light on the bottom was very bright red, and the light on the north side was white. The caller stopped her car before she passed underneath it, rolled her window down, and looked up at it.  She heard nothing, no sound whatever. She then drove on to the next intersection, turned her car around, hoping to see whether the object had left. It was then that she and her daughter witnessed a second object near the first, then a third and a fourth on the opposite side of the highway from the first, and very low to the ground.  Even though there was low ground fog, they could see the objects distinctly.  They saw a fifth object shortly afterward, at which point they decided to drive into town.  As they drove toward Clatonia, they saw another object come out of the fog. She called Columbus, NE, airport, where she learned that they had had no aircraft in the area at that time.  They also told her that they had a radar &quot;shadow&quot; in the area where her sighting had taken place	Denton Airfield	2.414869415	181072	2.199358629	4	7.7	403014	0.0000193	alien_abduction	0.001768868	0.037098609

19930209	19970116	Lufkin, TX	delta	5-7 min.	SUMMARY:  Family traveling home along a rural farm road spotted unusual lights/object in the sky moving slowly from east to west and pulled over to investigate.As we were traveling home along a rural farm road we spotted an unusual light in the sky moving slowly toward the road from east to west.  It didn&apos;t move like any familiar airplane, so we pulled over to watch for a minute.  The object was shaped similar to a Stealth, except with a thinner, smoother head-on profile, and with much more bluntly squared-off wingtips and nose.  It moved extremely slowly, no faster than a motorized hangglider,  and completely without engine noise, although it was at a relatively low altitude. (below low-hanging clouds.)  As it passed over our vehicle, its span covered the length of the Suburban.  It had a very large white spotlight at its nose and two bright lights at each wingtip.  The underside had many patterned rows of small colored lights, with an amber double row down the center.  The underside gave the impression of being textured or plated.  There was absolutely no engine noise, even though the craft was very low and very slow.  After pass!ing overhead, two or three small, blue &quot;sparkles&quot; dropped from the craft.  Not quite believing what we had witnessed, and not being fervent UFO watchers, we decided not to report the sighting. Witnesses were myself, a high school library director, my husband, an industrial chemist, and my 15-yr-old son.

MUFON State Director relays report: A group of 13 adult witnesses observe a large craft, decribed as a &quot;large box in the air.&quot;  The object looked like two terrapin shells attached at their edges, and tapering in the back.  The upper shell was dark, flat, slate gray; the other was beige.  The object was estimated to be approximately 50&apos; long and 30&apos; wide.  It was estimated to be 20x the diameter of the moon, viewed from the observers&apos; vantage point. The object was lit on the interior, and the observers could look into the lighted interior.  It did not hurt the observers&apos; eyes to look at the object.  The object was turning around its vertical axis at approximately 1 revolution per second.  It was fairly low in the sky, perhaps 1,000 feet, estimated by the observers, and it was moving from the northwest to the southwest.

It was 15 degrees to the draver&apos;s right, and 30 degrees above the horizontal, and it was hovering totally motionless.  The object clearly appeared to be rotating, and it occasionally would reflect sunlight, as if it had a flat side on it.  The observer pulled off the highway and stopped.  As he was watching it, the object instantly just disappeared.  The caller was trained in the military in photo analysis, and perhaps other specialties.  He was very precise in his description, using very unambiguous terms, and the proper use of angles, rather than distances. Also, he served in the UN forces in 1979 with the Peace Keeping Mission, arising out of the Camp David Accords.

The young men turned around, drove back down the road, where they found the father stopped in a turnout.  The father told them to turn off their engines and lights, and that there was something in the valley they should look at. The three of them witnessed six huge lights hovering in the night sky, and a seventh identical object sitting on the ground, which lit up the valley they were in for &quot;10 to 15 miles around.&quot;  The objects in the sky were oriented in a straight row.Suddenly, the object on the ground began to rise into the air, at which time the object positioned on the far right of the formation in the sky moved down and under its neighboring object.The light that had been on the ground disappeared from sight, and then the objects in the sky disappeared in sequence.  When they arrived at their destination, the father informed the others that he had seen another object &quot;on the other side of the mountain.&quot;				0	3	6.9	430055	0.0000182	alien_abduction	0.008576329	0.012752647

19970129	19970130	East Greenwich, RI	disk	5  minutes	SUMMARY:  I witnessed a UFO which may be of the Lazar&quot;Sport Model&quot; variety when I was leaving work to drive home.The UFO was circular in shape, with three distinct propulsion units on the bottom,and several red rectangular lights around the perimeter.  I witnessed this UFO when I was leaving work to drive home.  It was travelling in straight lines, forming a triangular pattern, approximate airspeed was about 150 MPH as far as I could tell.  I had the impression that it was of the type described by Bob Lazar, UUP/element 115propulsion. After approximately 5 minutes,the UFO sped away to the north.  I believe that I was in some kind of mental contact with the occupants of the craft at the time,as the triangular course seemed to circle directly around me also. I am currentlyworking on some sketches of the craft, bu tI thought it important to report the event as soon as possible.  I will email the sketches in JPEG format as soon as they are complete.Perhaps they were interested in this location because it is in proximity to several of our National Guard military installations.

I peeked through my blinds and saw a red light through the trees.  I went to my deck where I could see unobstructed and the red light was about 100 yards high.  It was a light that looked like a ruby with light coming through it.  It moved 2-3 degrees left and then right and then it disappeared.  The observer is a suburban housewife with a background in journalism and advertising.

19951224	19960226	Christiansburg, VA	triangle	1-2 min.	Man called to report that he, together with three other observers, had been witness to a an occurrence involving four aircraft, three of which appeared to be conventional-type military aircraft, and the fourth appeared to be an unusual, triangular-shaped object with non-conventional lighting. The observers first noticed two aircraft, which appeared to be flying a parallel course directly south, in tandem formation, at the same altitude, and separated by only 1/2 to 1 mile.  The apparent close proximity of the two aircraft is what first drew the observers&apos; attention and caused them to conclude that they were military aircraft, as opposed to commercial or private aircraft.  The individual who called and who submitted the written report stated that he and the other observers are familiar with the general flight characteristics of aircraft flying out of Roanoke, VA, airport, and they invariably maintain greater separation than what they observed for these two aircraft that had drawn their attention. Suddenly, the observers became aware of a third &quot;aircraft,&quot; which was directly ahead of the first two aircraft.  The observers immediately developed the impression that the third &quot;aircraft&quot; was being pursued by the first two they had witnessed.  The third object was less well illuminated that the first two, and its lighting pattern consisted of three red, somewhat &quot;subdued&quot; lights, arranged in a triangular pattern. Its size was approximately that of the other two aircraft. Approximately 30-60 seconds after the observers had spotted the first two conventional aircraft, they suddenly noticed that a third aircraft was flying from the northwest directly toward the triangular aircraft, apparently on a &quot;collision&quot; course with it, closing from the starboard side of the triangular-shaped aircraft, and flying at a somewhat higher speed that the triangular ship exhibited. Within seconds of sighting the fourth aircraft, the observers realized that none of the conventional aircraft were able to keep up with the triangular craft, all of them beginning to fall behind at the latter apparently began to accelerate.  The third conventional aircraft fell behind the triangle, and began to fly parallel to the other conventional aircraft. The incident was reported to the FAA in Roanoke, VA, and to Andrews AFB.

It was dark when she left home at 0400 hours, on 09JN96, and she had noted the moon in the eastern sky, so she knew what that celestial body looked like. At 0500 hrs., she noticed a &quot;slice of light&quot; above a nearby mountain top.  It was bright, &quot;like a star.&quot;  She continued to watch the object for an estimated 35 minutes (approx. 40 miles), and the object appeared to stay in the same location. She noted that whe was about the only vehicle on the highway, except for a truck that was behind her, &quot;approximately 2 miles.&quot;Then, the left side of the bright object blinked twice (she thought), and the whole object turned black, or perhaps gray.  However, the object remained stationary, and the &quot;core part&quot; of it appeared to the observer to be round.  She also added that the object looked like a &quot;sideways Vee.&quot;  (?) The object remained stationary during this part of her sighting.  However, when the object was abreast of her, off to the left (?) side, it suddenly disintegrated and disappeared, like an &quot;etch-a-sketch.&quot;  She believes she witnessed a UFO as a teenager.

19960620	19960620	Oakley, CA			Anonymous female calls to report sighting of peculiar object on previous evening. She was driving down highway and witnessed a large, flashing light above her.  At first, she thought it was a large jet, but it was &quot;almost floating.&quot;  The pack of the lights was irregular, quick, and sporadic.  They were principally red and white sporadic, flashing lights. She pulled off the road and witnessed the object change course and pass overhead.  When she arrived home, where she has an open bakc yard, she could see it in the distance.  It was almost ciruclar in shape, but it was flat in front.  It was almost as if the front of the object was cut off. She was frightened by the object, she felt fatigued when she got home, and she went straight to bed.					3	6.9	430055	0.0000182	alien_abduction	0.008576329	0.012752647		
19961003	19961209	Derby, CT	light	30 - 40 minutes	SUMMARY:  Two large lights were seen high in the sky. The objects swung around, changing position with one another, then the top object vanished.  The other remained visible as we traveled forabout 20 miles.I was driving, and my friend ((name delted)) was a passenger.  We were on Route 8, on our way from Naugatuck, CT to Norwalk, CT.  About 1/3 of the way to Norwalk, in Derby, I spotted two large, bright lights in the sky, and pointed them out to ((name deleted)).  The lights were larger than a visible planet would appear; the closest description I can give as to size was that they were similar in size to street lights viewed from a car, only they were clearly very high in the sky, so the actual size of the objects had to be enormous.  We watched the objects, which were hovering in place, the one on the left a little higher than the one on the right.  Suddenly, the objects moved, rotating around one another (top to bottom) to switch places with one another.  Then, the one which had moved to the top winked out, just vanished.  There was a faint trail leading upward where that one had been, but it disappeared quickly.  I drove another few exits to Shelton, CT, where we got off of the highway onto Bridgeport Avenue.  We stopped at a car dealership which had a clear view of that part of the sky (I&apos;d say, south, maybe south east part of the sky--I&apos;d have to look at a map to be more specific--we were driving generally south at the time).   We got out of the Jeep and stood in the lot, watching the remaining light.  It kept its position.  After a few minutes, we got back into the Jeep, and I continued to drive to Norwalk.  We watched the light all the way to Norwalk; it remained the in the same part of the sky the entire way (probably for a total of 20 miles or so), so it had to be pretty high up.  When I dropped ((name deleted)) off at her home, I had one more look at the object by a running track near her house, then I headed home (driving north, so I could no longer see it in front of me).  I couldn&apos;t see the part of the sky where it was when I got home, so I just went inside. The lights were pale yellow or white-ish in color.  I thought they seemed round, but ((name deleted)) said at the time (and has maintained) that they seemed triangular to her.  They were definitely not airplanes (we saw plenty of planes in the sky that night--no comparison).  They also didn&apos;t behave like planes.I&apos;m 29 years old, female, married, a webmaster/graphic designer by profession.  I&apos;ve never seen any unusual phenomena in the sky before, and have always been skeptical about the whole UFO thing.  While these lights may not be alien in nature, I certainly can&apos;t explain them (if you figure out what they were, please let me know!)  I don&apos;t know ((name deleted)) age (mid to late 40s perhaps).   She is currently attending college full time to get her masters in painting, and I believe a certificate to teach (or something of that nature).  If I can give you any further specifics, please contact me.	Sikorsky Heliport	1.563614212	457208	2.124131469	3	6.9	430055	0.0000182	alien_abduction	0.008576329	0.012752647

He saw 3 green lights in a triangular formation &quot;cruising&quot; overhead.  They were not moving very fast, and they clearly were not any kind of conventional aircraft. The observer went outside to get a better look at the lights, which were solid--not blinking--but they were gone.  However, he noted a very prominent light &quot;at the head of Orion.&quot;  the light was red, yellowish, and gold, and it had the shape of an arrowhead, but the back side of the object was &quot;recessed a bit.&quot;Then a second object joined the first!!  It looked like a small, white, flashing light.  Then both objects moved out over the Pacific Ocean.  At this point, the larger craft split into two separate objects, the two parts recombined, and then the formation disappeared over the horizon.

19790815	19961217	Beach Haven Terrace (Long Beach Island), NJ	fireball	4-5 seconds	SUMMARY:  Fireball flying parellel with the horizen,then exacuting a 90 deg. turn over the horizen.The setting; approx. 10:10pm on Long Beach Isl.New Jersey.  The weather was clear and the windwas minimal.  This Isl. is about 90 miles so.of N.Y. City, there at least two military basesrelatively close by.  There was 5 0r 6 of us sittingclose to the waterline at Beach Haven Terrace beach.  As this is a summer recreation areaand I was 19 years old at the time we were partying at the time of the sighting.  At thetime of the viewing I was not out of control perhaps slightly high but nowhere near to the point of halucinating (sorry about the spelling). I was facing the Ocean and I was just taking in the veiw, for example I noticed some boats and ships out for an evening cruise and that the Moon illuminated the sky enoughto see the eastern horizen very clearly. At thispoint out of my left eye I saw a very bright light parallel with the horizen, using my thumb at arms length I would estimate it at 1 or 2 degrees above the clearly seen horizen. Afterabout a second or two I shouted out to the othersto look over there. All but one of us saw it(the guy with his back to the sea was&apos;nt quickenough). by the time everyone looked it startedto do a 90 degree turn over the horizen and it did not appear to slow down, the fireball&apos;slight faded over the horizen within a secondor two.  And thinking back on the moment (later on that night whenI was tring to get to sleep) I believe I saw the siloutte of a cigar shape craft in frontos the fireball. This I can not be absolutly sure since my eyes did not have enough time to focus in on any details of what ever it was.I am also aware of the fact that it seemed to be reacting to my excitementfor the 90 deg. turn accured directly striaghtout from our position, a coincidence maybe, butI wonder.  I hope you can coralate this report with someoneelse who witnessed this event,I sure some of thefolkes on board some of those ships got an evenbetter look at it since they were much closer.I&apos;m just guessing but I believe it traveled atleast 2 or so in the time it was flying strightThe fireball did not get much bigger whenit was straight out from our position on the beachwhich is as close to sea level as one can get.With the help of a math oriented person you could get a rough ideaof how far it traveled and approx. speed.By the way I realize that CLOSE ENCOUNTERS OFTHE THIRD KIND had just come out in 77 and I really did want to see a UFO but at that timein my life I just had a passing interest inthe subject.  Hope this report helps.David Mitchell				0	2	8.5	563827	0.0000122	flying_saucers	0.000656599	0.066628751		
19970112	19970210	Billings, MT	light	5 minutes or less	SUMMARY:  Two bright red lights moving in perfect formation flew over Billings on the evening of Jan.12, 1997.  They were&nbsp;flying at an altitude normally too low for conventional aircraft.  Too slow for an airplane. . .almost as if they were gliding.  They made no sound.On the evening of January 12, 1997 around 11 pm I was at my girlfriend&apos;s house and went outside to try to start her car (it had been very cold that week and we had been trying to start it for a couple of days).  I went inside the car, tried to turn it on and it didn&apos;t start.  I got out of the car and two bright lights hovering over a set of trees caught my attention.  I knew that there were no lights (city or otherwise) that should have been there so I looked at them for a second or two.  They were really bright but at the same time kind of dull (hard to describe).  I moved a few steps away from the car and they started to move in a northeasterly direction.  When I first spotted the lights they were probably 1/4 to 1/2 a mile away.  I ran inside and told my girlfriend to come out and check them out.  She got on her boots and saw them but went back inside because it was at least 10 degrees below zero outside.  I ran out onto the street and followed their flight path.  They fl!ew from a southwest to northeast direction and were probably 60-70 degrees off of the horizon.  The two lights upon closer inspection appeared to be made up of more than one light, possibly five. . .occasionally they would blink (they blinked quickly, unlike any other airplane light I have ever seen)  The thing that struck me the most is how they stayed _perfect_ formation. . .not straying an inch from their formation.  It was as almost they were part of the same craft.  This might be the case, but if this is so that means that this craft was at least the size of 2 football fields.  They were completely silent.  Billings is set against a continuous series of cliffs which are about 60-100 feet in height.  In comparison to the Rims (as they are called) they were about 200 feet off of the ground.  They were flying too slow for any airplane that I know  of (plus, as i said they made no sound)  It was if they were gliding.  I ran up a side street and watched them pass over the rims!and pass just south of the airport, if not right over it.  I watched them glide off until they went over the horizon.  It was very strange, as the entire time I knew this was something that I have never seen before in person.  I tried to call the airport to confirm any unidentified aircraft but couldnt get through.  If there are any questions please email me.  I can positively state this was not any conventioal airplane.

The observer got his neighbor, and obtained his glasses.  Then, after 15-20 minutes, during which time the object was motionless, a military aircraft approached from the north, flying south, headed in the direction of the object, and which suddenly dove very fast, &quot;like a kamikaze.&quot; The object suddenly disappeared from sight, not to be seen againThe observer called KOGO Radio in San Diego.

19951025	19970101	Sandals Royal Jamaican Resort, Montego Bay (Jamaica),	rectangle	3 seconds	SUMMARY:  honeymooners see huge black object in sky illuminated by moon off the shore of Montego Bay. It glides by quickly and silently, then disappearsMy husband and I had just finished dinner at the restaurant at our Honeymoon Resort when we decided to walk along the beach back to our rooms. Most of the resort guests were at a barbeque on the nearby (50 yards away) island called Kokomo, so the resort was fairly quiet and we were alone, except for maybe an employee now and then. We decided to stop and enjoy the stars. We were both silently enjoying the view when I noticed a huge black object. ( I cannot however, determine how far away it was) it cast a slight reflection on the underneath side of it, as if the moon were glowing on it. The only way to describe the shape is to say it looked like a large stingray without a tail sailing through the sky. It did not make a sound, and it lasted only seconds. I could not figure out what I had seen, I hesitated, and then asked my husband if he had seen it too. He said yes, and said he was glad I had seen it because he though it was his imagination. We tried to explain it to ourselve!s, but the only thing we could come up with was that maybe it was a large black bird gliding over the water. But the only birds we had ever seen near the bay were totally white. The bird would have also had to have been within 5 feet in front of us to appear so large. We would have seen the bird clearly because the resort had small lamps that lit the nearby walkways, and we were able to view a gazebo that stretched out in front of us about 25 feet away. We tried unsuccessfully to see the object again, and finally gave up after about 15 minutes. I don&apos;t really recall the exact moment of the sighting, because it happened over a year ago, but we did immediately tell our family about in when we returned home. My husband and I are both college educated, 25 years old, and are successfully employed in the Washington, DC metro area. Please use this information as you wish. If it means anything to you, or is similar to anything ever reported, then please feel free to let us know, other!wise we just wanted to tell our story and remain anonymous.

It was small and luminous, but not very bright. It looked about three times the size of a regular star. I would have considered it to be a conventional aircraft, had it not been for the way it moved. It was extremely fast. It came in, slowed down somewhat, and then accelerated. Also, its path was a little erratic, not very smooth. After about only five seconds I lost sight of it. It could have disappeared behind the ridge, but to me it looked like it simply vanished. My friend and I are both senior psychology students at Arizona State University. My friend is extremely skeptic with regard to UFOs, but we both agree that it wasn&apos;t an airplane, a helicopter, or a satelite.				0	4	7.7	403014	0.0000193	alien_abduction	0.001768868	0.037098609

She went into the bathroom to tend to her arm, and the husband lay on the bed, with his feet facing to the west as he looked out the double French doors to the west. Suddenly, he noticed a large, orange, luminous object, seemingly in the distance, that appeared to be flying directly toward his location.  At first, he thought it might be a reflection of the security keypad on the wall by his bed, but he quickly realized that its color is green, not the shade orange or red he was observing. The husband got out of bed and continued to observe to object by looking through the center pane of the door.  The object was brilliantly bright, and it looked like a fireball.  Suddenly, the object made a 90 degree turn to the south, at which time its &quot;firey&quot; tail could be seen by both him and his wife.  The wife commented that it was &quot;like a comet.&quot;  The tail&apos;s color was golden orange, and it was &quot;bigger on top&quot; than it was on the bottom.  Also, material was being ejected from the object, and it appeared to be burning.  The object just seemed to dissapate in the southern sky. The caller added that he does not see how anyone in the San Joaquin Valley could have missed it.Also, the caller added that when he was a graduate student in Long Beach, CA, in 1974, he saw a formation of four triangular shaped objects, imbedded in a cloud of green tinted light, pass overhead of his penthouse apartment and head north.				0	3	6.9	430055	0.0000182	alien_abduction	0.008576329	0.012752647

Two witnesses.Sitting in back yard with my wife, we were facing south watching the sky because I had seen something similar to this the previos year that my wife could not see. I looked over my right shoulder to the NNW. As I looked into totaly clear skys with bright stars this object appeared in my field of vision. Just as I saw it I said to my wife who had just turned her head, &quot;Do you see that&quot;, her reply was &quot;Oh my God I do&quot;. We both watched it proceed about cloud height above our heades and move very steadily to the SSE in the direction of Denver. I had my camera with and tryed to take pictured but they were only black when developed. As we watched it disappeared before it was at a distance that we thought it should have. It just faded out. The object appeared to be illuminated by ground lights from the city, and looked like the front edge, and bottom of a disk. It had the shape of a cresent moon, with a slight point in the center and back. There was no sound. Judging by the hight !it seemed to be around 100ft-150ft across.About a year before this we had been sitting in the same place in the yard and I saw the same thing going in the opposite direction (SSE to NNW)  that was the same shape, size, and hight, except that it had four rectangular blocks of light on the leading edge, and my wife could not see it even though she was looking exactly where I pointed. If there were any other sighting in the area around the same time, I&apos;m interested.

He was driving his van east on Route 313 (?) in Bedminster Township, approximately 3 miles north of Doylestown, PA, when he observed three very bright objects, which he interpreted to be &quot;shooting stars.&quot;Approximately 2-3 minutes later, as he was descending a steep grade in the road, his lights and engine began to falter, then they quit altogether very abruptly.  Also, the van stopped very suddenly, although he noted that he was not thrown forward when it stopped, which he thought was unusual.  Then he felt &quot;something move through the truck,&quot; and when he attempted to turn the ignition key to restart the van&apos;s engine, he could not move, either his hand, or any other part of his body.  It was at this point that he felt that something was in the van with him, which was &quot;reading his thoughts.&quot;  He later added that it felt that there was something &quot;right inside his brain.&quot;  This part of the experience lasted, he thought, &quot;only a second.&quot;Suddenly, he noted that the engine in his van was running again, even though he had not tried to restart the engine.  It just started of its own accord. He added that it had been very windy that night, but when the object was above him, there was a sudden &quot;whoosh&quot; of air, and it was gone. He saw no bright lights, nothing discrete or palpable.  He woke his girlfriend when he got home, and wrote down the whole incident.I called Paul G. Johnson, SD for MUFON in Pennsylvania.

At about 0215 hrs., he estimates, he saw a peculiar blue light, which he estimated to be about 100 yards from his location.  It was visible between two trees. He jumped out of his truck, ran into the parking lot, and he got a better look at the object.  It was a blue light, moving very slowly, approximately 100 feet above the ground.  It was moving from his left to right. The moon was out at the time.  The object moved in front of a cloud, so it was silhouetted against the light colored cloud, at which point the observer could see its shape.  It was distinctly square in shape.  The observer described the object as looking like a &quot;coffee table (round?) with a smaller rectangular box on top--like a shirt box.&quot;  Box was about 1/3 the size (diameter?) of the round part.  The object then moved away from him, the observer estimating that it may have moved approximately 1/4 mile in one second.  It then hovered for a short period of time, then it streaked toward the observer, coming within 100 feet of his position, this time, and still about 100 feet in the air.  The object then moved to the left, then the right, moving &quot;like a bug in the wind--erratically.&quot;  The object flew over the tope of the hospital and disappeared from the observer&apos;s sight.

Young woman watching television while sitting on beanbag in bedroom observed a very bright green cylinder go streaking across the sky and disappear behind Hogsback Mountain.

Itappeared that &quot;stuff was coming out the back.&quot;  It illuminated the entire area with green light. the sighting was during the David Letterman program.  A taxi driver had just left the stage, and Bill Cosby was about to come on. She called the police, who reported that two pilots in the area had reported a green flash.

19961218	19961218	Eugene, OR	light	1 hour	SUMMARY:  Father and son saw a light at high altitude perform zig-zags, abrupt starts and stops, and 90 degree turns.I am 18. I was going to bed at 0430 when I looked out the window at the sky. I saw what I tought to be a satellite or the space shutle slowly and steadily track across the sky from the south-east twards the north-west. I watched this object for a minute and than it stoped. I thought it was strage, but I sthat it might be a satellite that had moved itself into a geosynchronous orbit or possibly the space shutle that had done the same. Than it started to move strangely. It started to do little zig-zag patterns and move very slowly and rock back and forth. It also did a couple of 90 degree turns. I watched it for about 10 minutes, than I went and woke up my dad. He came and we watched it zig-zag and turn and start and stop and do spirals. The spirals seemed strange, to me, because it would start out with a big, slow circle and than the circle would began to tighten and it would speed up untill it had come to rest where it started. I think I can best desc!ribe the spirals as looking like a planet falling into the sun. All this time the sum of its movemets were bringing it twards the west (twards us). My window faces East. At one point I thought I saw a small light seperate from it and head South-West. It was so faint that I wouldent have thought anything of it except that my dad asked me if I saw it. My dad went back to bed about 0515 and by 0530 it was out of sight over my roof. I thought about going outside to watch it some more, but I thought it was too cold and I had watched it for an hour anyway, though I hope I didn&apos;t miss any big exit.;)	Sacred Heart General Hospital Heliport	1.323141284	343609	2.358672863	3	6.9	430055	0.0000182	alien_abduction	0.008576329	0.012752647

I was stunned.When I got to L.A., I got the film developed, had 1 picture with a fuzzy  saucer in it, took it to a photo lab and had them enlarge the fuzzy saucer.  Well, they did not have digital imaging back then and I am leery of releasing the articles. That was 24 years ago and I still think about it as if it were yesterday.

It had windows, and each window had a different color in it!  It was generally oblong in shape, and it looked to be &quot;smaller than her Cadillac.&quot;  There were sections on the object that she could not see because of the lighting, perhaps its location, as well as its brilliance.  It gave off no sound.  Two of the callers friends had seen it, also.  Suddenly, the object zoomed off.At least two other people, friends of the caller, saw it, as well.

19970108	19970127	Brooklyn, CT	disk	2 seconds	SUMMARY:  Flat, round object heading rapidly SE horizontally.I was on my way home from work on roads I&apos;ve travelled at this time of day for the past 35 years. Suddenly this object appeared coming from behind me above tree level heading in a SE direction relatively horizontal. It was very clear and bright (a whitish sort of metallic light). There was no haze or bluriness at all. The object was circular with very clear edges. It appeared to have either a raised middle section or a lighted area around the center. It was travelling at tremendous speed and was out of sight in just a couple of seconds. At first I thought it was a reflection but there are no street lights in the area and it was going too fast. It definitely was not an airplane nor a shooting star. It was too sharp and clear for a shooting star and too round for an airplane. Besides, it was going too fast for a plane, even a jet. I have worked at the University of Connecticut since 1961 and have never seen anything like this on any of the roads I travel to get to and from wor!k which is 28 miles from home. I have seen another strange sighting at home in Moosup, CT 06354. I was outside one night with my dog. While she was doing her business, I was looking at the stars. Suddenly a light appeared just like a light bulb had been turned on and darted across the sky. It was quite a while ago, maybe a couple of years, so I don&apos;t remember exactly which way it was going after it &quot;lit up.&quot; I think it went from NW to SE at a rapid rate and was out of sight in just a few seconds, probably five or six.

According to UPI, U.F.O. sightings were reported in eight states at the same time of the Nyona Lake sighting. Unsure of  exact date.The U.P.I. story stated that the air force said that what was seen was the planet Jupiter. Robert Risser director of thre Oklahoma Science and Art Foundation planetarium in Oklahoma City , said that watchers in Oklahoma certainly did not see the planet. &quot;that is as far from the truth as you can get.

He looked to the north, and suddenly noticed an object flying above the northern horizon.  It was just a bright ball of fire with the speed of a &quot;falling star.&quot;  The object just shot across the sky!  The observer&apos;s impression was that it was a large object, perhaps the size of a Boeing 747.The observer&apos;s first reaction was that it was a meteor, but it suddenly stopped, did a 180 degree turn, then shot back to the northwest, and suddenly disappeared.  His impression was that the object had covered a distance of 20 miles in perhaps a very short period of time, measured in seconds. After the object started back to the northwest, it accelerated, then slowed, and then regained speed.  However, it accelerated very fast, not like an aircraft. The observer pulled across the highway and went into a McDonald&apos;s Restaurante parking lot, where he sat for 3-4 minutes to see if the object would return.

Their impression was that the lights were not very far away, and perhaps at an altitude of 2,000 to 3,000 feet.  They appeared to be low. After several seconds, the objects disappeared from sight, then reappeared shortly soon after.  The second object suddenly shot off.  About 3-4 minutes later, they saw them in the northwest sky.  Initially, it was one bright, orange,  large light, which then split into approximately 5 objects.  They formed a formation for about 5-10 seconds, which then simply disappeared.

Even though they could not make out the shape of the object because of its distance from them, it appeared to be proceeding from north to south at a steady pace.  It was midway (vertically) between Venus and the moon.  They were located on E. Milman Road on Whidbey Island when they observed the object(s) .

I first assumed it was Venus, but the caller was adament that when an airplane flew nearby, the object shot off to the south as far as he could see, then it came back to its original position!!  Then, while we were talking, he stated that it suddenly dropped down significantly to the horizon.I could hear the other parties in the background talking about the object.  One woman, who was looking at the object with some form of magnification, stated that it looked like it had &quot;seven panels&quot; on the bottom of it.  The caller stated that it looked like it had two headlights on it, with a bar running down the middle, perhaps.  This one is confusing!!  How can Venus streak to the south, and drop down. I asked them to watch it tonight, and to look for it again tomorrow night in the same area of the sky.

Husband and wife called to report sighting of 6 bright orange balls of light above the Wenatchee River.At first, they witnessed an orange glow moving parallel to the Wenatchee River.  The altitude, they thought to be about 400-500 feet, and they appeared to be about 3 feet in diameter. Two of the objects were close together, with the third one lagging behind a bit.  Then, they looked to the west, and they noticed three more similar objects coming from the west, whence the first three had come.  Two of the second group were close together, with the third one standing off somewhat, as in the first case. The objects rose up to a higher altitude, and went over the ridge, or hill, to the east of their position.  They reported the sighting to the local sheriff&apos;s office.  They added that a local disc jockey with KPQ Radio had reported seeing something very similar a few days earlier, and he talked about it over the radio.

19961123	19961123	Stockton, CA		30 min.	A woman called to report that she and her daughter, after going to a pharmacy, were driving home from Lodi to Stockton along Route 3 and other rural roads. Suddenly, her daughter saw a big round disc, with bright lights inside its rim, that appeared to be following them.  They lost it and got back in the car (!!), and went to a second pharmacy.  When they left the second pharmacy, they witnessed the object a second time, this time right beside their car.  They got a very good look at the object this time. It appeared to them to be the size of an aircraft--perhaps a 747--and it was distinctly round.  When asked, the caller said she thought it was more spherical than circular.  It had many white lights on it, perhaps a hundred or more. The occupants of other cars saw it, too.  There were possibly two other cars that had stopped, and the occupants were standing outside looking at the object.  They were stopped in an area which is totally dark, with nothing but fields around.They called the Lodi Police to inquire whether there had been other calls.  They said there had been no other calls. I gave the caller Ruben Uriarte&apos;s address.					3	6.9	430055	0.0000182	alien_abduction	0.008576329	0.012752647		
19951101	19961227	Lakeport (near), CA	light	5 hours	SUMMARY:  Two brothers hunting 6 miles from the main road. Parked on a pullout near the top of the ridgetop. Saw red-green halo light moving across opposite ridgetop where no road existed.  Traversed ridge at medium speed then stopped, shot up to higher altitude, performed some unusual aerial manuevers before parking in the sky to the SE. It was soon joined by another identical light which also became stationary.  A large, flat, silent dark perfect triangular craft came down between the two lights and proceeded directly by them up the valley. It flew below the top of the ridge and was clearly visible for 30 seconds to a minute before it passed out of sight. The two lights remained where they were and were visible even after daylight.&quot;Dunn sighting&quot; two. The brothers were hunting near Highland Springs and were again sitting in their truck parked in a pullout near the ridgetop facing east, looking out over the valley between them and the opposite ridge.  It was approximately 1/2 to 3/4 mile across. Suddenly a light appeared to the NE over the opposite ridge.  They both thought it was a vehicle at first but having hunted the ridge they knew there was no road there only brush.  At brushtop height and as large as a truck the light progressed along the ridge.  Viewing it with a 20power spotting scope they describe it as a redish-green pulsing light with a clear white light in the middle.they didn&apos;t know what it was but were able to follow it in the scope,(on a tripod), until it reached the end of the ridge to the SE. There it &apos;jumped&apos; back and forth in the sky for a number of minutes. They were unable to keep it in the viewfinder during these &apos;jumps&apos;.  It then became stationary in the sky.  After a while, from the SE and much further away, a second identical light appeared and flew toward the first one, joining it slightly further to the west but also stationary.  The two lights never moved again.  About 04:30 a large flat, dark and perfectly triangular craft came from between the two lights.  At first they thought it was a plane but it came directly down the canyon they were looking out over, from SE to NW, and lower than the opposite ridge.  It flew at a steady crusing speed and made no sound except for the sound of air being pushed, like a hissing breeze. There was a slight haloed gaseous effect coming from the craft that made it difficult to observe with !the scope but didn&apos;t affect the nnaked eye.  A single spotting clear light shone out ahead from the middle underside of the craft.  What appeared to be windows also were apparent.  They both felt that if they could see it, it could see them and they felt like sitting ducks!  However they were not as frightened as the first time they witnessed a sighting. The way it cruised by reminded them of tourists driving through town.  They estimated it at approximately 25 yards wide.  As it passed two red lights, like taillights shone out from the back of the craft.  They waited for the noise but none came.  They stayed at the spot until dawn, viewing the two original bright lights.  These lights remained in exactly the same location and were so bright they could still be observed after daylight.  They finally got tired of watching and drove home.  Two interesting questions are posed by their two sightings in different wilderness locations.  Either they are simply fortunate to have been !in the direct paths, away from civilization, of these vehicles and their sightings are mere coincidences, or the crafts flew by them purposely.  In both cass they were entirely visible to any vehicle at a higher altitude from great distances away.  Also it seems outlandishly coincidental that they just happened on the particular routes of these crafts, when miles of alternative wilderness areas exist. It may also indicate a similar flight pattern of wilderness routing though it seems odd that if this routing exists to decrease sightings, no attempt was made to hide themselves from these two entirely visible observers.  The Dunn&apos;s are totally reputable men, from midland farm families, as down to earth as you can get!  They never even considered the possibility of what they witnessed until it was before them.  they still exhibit some fear as to the identity and purpose of the crafts and have not discussed or reported the events publicly. But they are now watching continually.  D!unn sighting one contains the report of their first sighting as well as their most recent land -based phenomena sighting.  They are taking me to the sights soon. I&apos;m looking forward to it!    wolf				0	1	5.8	61018	0.000017	alien_abduction	0.012320329	0.010652726		
19790901	19961207	Rockford/Belvedere (between), IL	disk	5-10 MIN	SUMMARY:  Saw a very large object 1000-1500 ft in diameter having difficulty.  Saucer shaped about twice the size of a quarter held at arms length about 2 miles distant.  Rotating  windows from left to right.  Saucer was wobbling very slowly for about 5 minutes.  About 20 windows observable.  Looking at object to west.  Reported to Pecatonica state police about 1 hour later and laughed at.  Reported to J.A. Hynek; NW University next dawith drawing sent in later.  I have had my son approximate these drawings with computer graphics.  It finally stabilized and floated away to the NW toward Pecatonica.  Only  a white blinking light remained after window lights were shut off.  Light appeared to be center top.  Also, no sound and other witnesses did not seem to be too concerned that they did not what this object was.  The wife and I know!Background will mildly rolling with numerous houses and apartments visable.  Object was at time below the horizon in a slight valley just to the west of the Bel-ford theater on IL RT 20 which runs between Rockford and Belvidere.  This object was extremely large and seemed massive-heavy but suspended in the air and wobbling slowly like when you spin a frisbee on a string. spin it slowly and then strike one side.  At the time I told Hynek&apos;s secretary that I thought that the windows measured about 20&apos; x 70&quot;. 20 wide - 70 high.  In retrospect, I underestimated these dimensions.  Probably more like 50 by 300.  At that time John Anderson from Rockford was running for president.  Haven&apos;t heard much about him lately. He lost as a third party candidate.  I am 49 years old now but it is still vivid in our memories.  Most people look us strangely when we mention it.  Neither of us have seen anything similar since.  We also called the Rockford Airport the next day and they said they had seen nothing unusual on rader the night before.  They said it was probably an advertising plane pulling a lighted banner.  Yea, right!  I have never seen an ad plane that makes no sound, flying around at midnight with a lighted sign the size of Commisky Park.  I just gave up trying to convince peiople.  I guess it doesn&apos;t really matter anyway.  Sooner or later everyone will see these.				0	2	8.5	563827	0.0000122	flying_saucers	0.000656599	0.066628751

19961213	19961214	Simi Valley, CA	egg	4 min	SUMMARY:  A silver metallic object streaked across the sky in a northeast direction. It suddenly slowed to a complete stop before going straight up and performing zig zag maneuvers. It then shot off in the NE direction.  Within 45 minutes we observed 2 fighter jets flying in tight wing formation going in the same direction as the UFO.The ufo appeared to be a slightly flattened egg shape. It was a clear cloudless day, with only con trails from the airplanes in the sky. Sunlight glinted off the top and the bottom.  The object was heading toward was the Malibu, CA area.  The area where we were observing is comprised of hills and agricultral zones.  Because of the cooler temperature, all planes in the sky were leaving con trails, however the ufo did not.  I am unable to estimate how high, or how big the object was, although it did not appear to be all that high, or all that large.  The hill directly beneath the object when it stopped had sheep grazing at the time.  The speed the object moved was amazing, as were the complicated maneuvers it performed.  Approximately 45 minutes later we observed 2 fighter jets flying in close tight wing formation and heading in the direction the ufo had taken.  One of the gentlemen with me if familar with planes and fighter jets as his father was a lifer in the Air Force, and!he spent nearly all of his growing up years on AF bases.  One other interesting point, the ufo was going in the direction of Rockadyne, a company facility that builds and tests rocket engines. That is all I can think of at the moment. I am a scheduler/ dispatcher for a technical service and support department.  My educational back ground is 2 years of college, and working in the Customer Service and Support field for 23 years.  I am interested in ufology, although I am not involved with any ufo groups.  There were 2 men beside myself who saw the ufo.  They are both in the sales field for our company, and other than the gentlemen with the AF background, I am not sure of the complete back ground of the men.

It looked like a &quot;flattened oval of soft red/orange light.&quot;  It made a perfect arc across the sky.  It covered 2/3 of the sky during its movement.  Then, the observer realized that it could not be a search light, for example, because it was above the clouds, and he would have seen the light passing through the clouds.  The light moved across the sky in a perfect arc, as if tethered to the ground.  It appeared to travel from east to west.The clouds at the time were high and &quot;transparent.&quot;The caller volunteered that he has a slight color anomaly in his vision, and he believes anyone with normal color perception would have found the light to be more prominent in the sky than it was to him.

It had a red flashing strobe on it.  Also, it was very low, and it went below the level of the tops of the trees.

19950101	19970214	Tucson, AZ	triangle	5-10 minutes	SUMMARY:  120-140 ft, X 35-40 ft, X 30 ft, triangler craft, metalic colored, 4 lights directly down the center with 2 strobes and 3 very large lights on the backOn or between Dec 27th 1994 and Jan 5, 1996 at 2100 hours, I went out to get my dog in from the back yard of my home, (6350 East Hayne).  He was in a playful mood and I began to throw small stones which he would chase.  As I was walking over to pick up a few small stones in the corner of walled in yard, I happen to grance up into the very clear, cloudless sky and noticed a darken object very low to the ground.  At first I could not determine if the craft was moving.  At this point it was quite some distance away, approx 1 to 1 1/2 miles.  I continued to watch the craft and it began to get larger.  I knew the craft was obviously coming in my direction.  I kept wondering why the aircraft had not turned on its landing lights be cause the U.S. Air Force Base (Davis-Monthan AFB) was only a few miles south of my home.  The base is almost directly south of my home the the Tucson International Airport is just on the other side (slightly southwest).  I immediately called the craft to!my daughters attention who had just come out to tell me one of my favorate programs had just come on.  We both stood there watching as the craft got closer.  When it was approximately 3/4 mile from us,  it&apos;s true shape became visible.  It was a triangle shaped craft, moving very slowly at approximately five to eight miles per hour.  It was approximately 75 to 100 feet above the ground.  It had no lights on the front of the craft at all.  I told my daughter that it was going to pass almost directly over us.  When it got to only a few hundred feet away, we began to see lights on the bottom of it.  There were four lights that were in a straight line down the middle of it that ran the full lenght.  The lights were spaced about 20 feet apart.  As it passed slightly infront and above us, we could see very clearly that the craft was metalic in color and did not have a smooth surface but appeared to have a plated surface.  I could see what appeared to be lines of rivits that connecte!d them togather.  The craft did not make a single sound, and after spending 18 years on active duty in the Air Force, I knew it was not something that was man made.  It I were going to guess at its weight based on its size as mentioned above---I would say approxmiately 80 to 110 tons.  As I passed by my daughter was the first to notice two stobes on the rear corners that were blinking very fast (much faster than normal aircraft), both were white lights and could only be seen from behind.  Even when the craft was at its closest point from us, could not be seen until the rear of the craft began to become visable.  It was at this pont that I could even more clearly see the previously mentioned plating affect.  I was able to at this point based on the visible edges of the triangle in my own mind determine the thickness of the craft .  The back of the craft had three very large lights , two approximately 10 feet in diamenter and the third much larger light between them.  It was abo!ut 15 feet in diamenter.  It may sound strange but the lights were not giving off a really bright light but definately light that appeared to be defused.  The lights on the bottom of the craft appeared defused as well.  The craft was close enough that a man with a good strong throwing arm could have easily hit it.  I know that this story sounds like something out of a science fiction book, but I swear it&apos;s the truth.  I will be more than willing to take any lie-detector test you want.  Feel free to contact me concerning this sighting.  I almost forgot--the following day after the close encounter, while in the restroom of my home preparing to shower or something i remember finding a blister about the size of a dime just above my left ankle.  There was no pain, and I only noticed it as I was taking of my sock.  I pressed slightly on it and rolled my index finger around.  It poped and I expected to feel pain but there was none.  I pealed away the lose skin and noticed that the ti!ssue that should have appeared red or pink was brown.  Normally, blisters don;t leave scars in a perfect circle--this one did.  The only reason I have taken this time to tell you about what we seen, is that I can&apos;t stop thinking about it.  I hope if have really reached someone who will take the time necessary to confirm my sighting anyway they have to.  Now I know for sure--They do exist and I don&apos;t care who says they don&apos;t.  That includes our goverment.	University Medical Center Hospital Heliport	1.457670815	491080	2.326587005	1	5.8	61018	0.000017	alien_abduction	0.012320329	0.010652726

It was about 30 to 50 feet in diameter andgoing extremely fast. About one second behind it was an Air Force jet fighter.  The UFO was traveling much faster than the jet.  They were so low that had it been daylight I could have read any markings on the jet. The UFO glowed very brightly and was the color of fluorescentl ight tubes. This is all I know. Yes, I realize 26 years is a long time, but I thought itmight help verify someone else&apos;s sighting.				0	1	7.2	25857	0.000014	flying_saucers	0.142857143	0.001071835

After that we drove the turkback to the fule center. I was looking toward the northward end of the runway and saw a UFObut ny brother didn&apos;t see it because he was looking the other direction while putting the ladder in the truck. It zipped across the sky at around 400 M.P.H and was bright green, really bright and it wasn&apos;t a plane, it was crossing the landing approach pattern. It came down from around 1000 feet to about 200 feet, then speed extremely fast westward while hugging the groung,about 150 feet above the local houses and dissappeared westward toward the bay. The object, to my caclulations must have been at least 70 feet in diameter and was circular. I am a current student as well as my brother in high school. I have seen many pictures of ufo&apos;s onTV and on the Sightings UFO report video. It looked similar to a ufo that I saw on TV that just zoomed across the sky in Mexico City.There was not any noise heard and the sky was very clear that night, the first clear day in about a week after large storms.I am not sure if anybody else saw it, but there wasn&apos;t many people at the airport in the area that we were in, but some peoplewho live in the houses next to the golf course, which is at the end of the runway towards the direction that the object was seen,might have seen the UFO. It was definately not a Learjet and didn&apos;t have flashing lights.P.S I will try to find a map and draw some pictures and e-mail them to you				0	3	6.9	430055	0.0000182	alien_abduction	0.008576329	0.012752647

She looked up and witnessed four lights very close together, with three more behind them, then three more still behind the first two groups.  The formation stretched across approximately one third the distance from horizon to horizon!!  They appeared to stop, start moving again, then speed up again in erratic fashions.  He friend noted that the flashing lights were &quot;wavering.&quot;  It appeared to both the observers that there were three lights on each &quot;vehicle,&quot; one quite bright, and two &quot;weaker&quot; ones. The formation passed directly above their heads, at which point three &quot;objects&quot; formed a triangle, and &quot;three of them in back lagged off.&quot;  No sound was detectable.After the objects had disappeared from sight, the observers heard an aircraft sound coming from behind them.  It turned out to be a commercial jet aircraft, which appeared to be moving very slowly, relative to the (angular) velocity of the peculiar objects they had just witnessed.She received our telephone number from the Eureka Police.					3	6.9	430055	0.0000182	alien_abduction	0.008576329	0.012752647		
19970124	19970129	Alta, UT	other	3 hours plus	SUMMARY:  A &quot;moving star&quot; similar to a satellite stopped, hovered, and darted around for over 3 hours.  A telescope revealed a round shape.I observed what I took to be a satellite, until it shifted direction, and then stopped.  It was slightly brighter than the brightest stars in the sky, and not an unusual color.  It would hover for awhile, then move, sometimes appearing to spin in circles.  I first looked at my watch at 19:11, after having watched the object for perhaps 10 minutes.The object hovered in basically the same part of the sky for over three hours, at times appearing to drift, and then bring itself back to where it was before.  It often just hovered perfectly still, and looked like a star. It was roughly overhead of Alta, very high, a little  to the northeast.  Witnesses who saw it move included a member of the Alta Fire Department, a dispatcher for the Alta Marshall&apos;s office,And two members of the astronomical society at the Hansen Planetarium in Salt Lake.  They happened to have a nice 3inch wide telescope, and were photographing the moon.  With a higher powered eyepiece, the telescope showed the object to be pefectly round, with a darker round circle in the center.  I think the telescope was about 12000x, if I recall correctly.  The object was absolutely still in the telescope.I think the image in the telescope was consistent with looking up at the underside of a perfectly round flying saucer.  No lights were apparent on the object.  It appeared to be reflecting light from the sun which gave it the appearance of a star to the naked eye. Conceivably, this was some type of satellite being put into a fixed orbit, except for the erratic motion.  With my arm outstretched, it moved the length of my thumb, at the most.  I would like more information on types of satellites.  Personnel at the Hansen Planetarium weren&apos;t aware of any satellites that can behave like that.  I am a former Assistant Chief of the Alta Fire Department.	Cirque Lodge Studio Heliport	7.32039356	133315	2.340909814	4	7.7	403014	0.0000193	alien_abduction	0.001768868	0.037098609

19920615	19961207	Area 51, NV	oval	12 hrs.	SUMMARY:  4 adults video tape object over area 51 in Nevada. Video shown on 2 different episodes of &quot;Unsolved Mysteries&quot;.In 1992, 4 of us were able to capture on video some of the maneuvers of the &quot;Area 51&quot; object.  It shows the craft hovering, then moving down the ridge line until it disappears.  Also on video, the morning sequence which showed the craft pulsate and become brighter.  This is the segment used on Unsolved Mysteries.  Once it became totally dark it was nearly impossible to capture all of the maneuvers on video.  This thing could go from horizon to horizon in just seconds.  It would fly just like a meteor, stop on a dime, then go in a completely different direction.  We all saw the craft become brighter,almost as if it were gaining energy, then shoot across the sky.  After doing several maneuvers, the light would become dim, then go out.  The other 3 said,&quot;it just disappeared&quot;, but I was looking thru binoculars and saw what appeared to be an egg shape craft with the slightest pearlescent green glow. I watchedit go out of range.  The craft would be gone for approx. 45 minutes, then at the exact same time, all 4 of us heared a high pitch frequency &quot;inside&quot; our heads.  Then instantly, the object would appear.  I saw thru the binos what appeared to be some sort of docking with a larger ship.  There were several smaller ships throughout the evening which appeared to me as if they were helicopters observing from a distance. I am a private pilot and a former Marine.  I&apos;ve spent alot of time around planes and helo&apos;s.  This main craft was definitely not one of those.  Finally, what seemed to bother all of us the most was toward dawn, the craft came to a stop, and almost appeared to mimic a star.  It stayed in rotation with the rest of the stars &apos;till dawn.

He turned on his porch light, thinking someone was coming up his driveway, and went out onto his front porch.  He heard a strange, somewhat loud noise coming from the sky, and when he looked up, he saw three different-colored lights overhead in a triangular pattern.  The sound was like a &quot;roaring engine sound.&quot;  The object did not look like any kind of aircraft that he is familiar with. Moreover, the one large craft was surrounded by several smaller objects that had the appearance of flashing red lights.  They stood off from the larger object in the center of the formation.  He estimated their distances from the central object to be 1,000 to 2,000 feet, but he said that was only an estimate. His impression was that only the object in the center was creating the sound that had first drawn his attention.

His friend, who is frequently joking, hit the caller on the shoulder and told him to turn around and look.  His friend grabbed him and physically turned him around. The caller, at first sceptical  about the request, turned and saw a &quot;triangle of lights&quot; in the sky.  The lights formed an isosceles triangle from the viewers&apos; vantage point, with equal distances between the lights. The &quot;point&quot; (i.e. apex) of the lights was facing west.  On the right side of the object, there simply was nothing!  Nothing was visible. The object was very lareg, twice the size of the caller&apos;s thumbnail, held at arm&apos;s length, i.e. about 4-5 times the diameter of the moon. The object moved from the viewers&apos; right to left, dipped, rose up, dipped again, rose again, then shot off to the left. The caller reported that the movement of the object were &quot;fluid.&quot;  Also, the object generated a &quot;shimmering effect&quot; around its periphery.  It looked like a &quot;camouflaged shield.&quot;					3	6.9	430055	0.0000182	alien_abduction	0.008576329	0.012752647

Lights flashing out of sync. red,blue,green,yellow,white and other colors. Rotated and slowley moved south.+On April 23 at 1:30am, a friend and I were camping in the woods in snoqualmie washington.I first noticed some lights high above us over and hill and commented that it looked like an airplane. He said it looked more like a helicopter.The clouds were fairly low and it was hard to tell so we forgot about it. A few moments later,we noticed that it was heading our direction. As it came down a hillside, we noticed that it had colors not consistant with regular aircraft.Red,blue,green,white, and yellow (there may have been other colors.) Lights were all over it flashing out of sync with each other. As it broke through the cloud cover, we saw air turbulence behind it. Not as an engine disturbing the clouds, but just as an object moving through it. It came to almost a hover aprox. 75 feet overhead and aprox 60 yards away. It made no sound and did not disturbe the trees it was very close to.Then a group of lights on the bottom rotated to the back and it rotated away from us. We noticed that we could see the color of the lights reflecting off the clouds overhead. The clouds were very low, almost a fog. It then headed south away from us.I have known my friend for 18 years, and he attends Western Washington University. I hesitated to submit this form, because everyone I have told has not believed. I hope that by telling, it will help in some small way.	Fall City Airport	1.440230384	505783	2.326587005	1	5.8	61018	0.000017	alien_abduction	0.012320329	0.010652726

After several minutes, when the objects had not disappeared from their sight, the mother obtained a pair of binoculars and looked at the bright lights.  To her amazement, the objects looked shiney black, and cylindrical in shape.  They had no visible wings.  In addition, they had strobe-like lights on the bottom, and they flashed like fireworks. No clouds in the sky.  Suddenly, one object rose vertically up into the sky.

19880315	19970217	Gallup (~10 miles west of on I-40), NM	cylinder	1 minute	SUMMARY:  Driving west on I-40 just after dark, saw lights strobing over median of hwy. Thought it might be a helicopter, but there was no noise and the unique pattern of lights. I passed almost under it and began to slow but it had disappeared. Two hours later,on same hwy., a brown cylinder shape hovered and passed over my car. I estimated the first sight to be 40 ft up and ~40 ft wide and the second sight to be 2 and 1/2 ft long and 1 ft around.The first sighting was quite large, at least40 ft wide, with lights centered in the middle.There were three large lights, flashing not on and off but in an alternating pattern. I couldn&apos;tsay if it disappeared after I passed under it,because it was quite dark, but the lights were gone. The second sighting was around Joseph City,Arizona, on I-40.  It reminded me of a large poster tube, light brown.  It hovered at the farthest reach of my headlights directly in front of the car for about 20 seconds, came straight at the windshield to about a foot and a halfand went over the car.  I was driving for a posting job I had held at that time for about 8 months. I had left that day from Santa Fe, NM where I was visiting a friend. After the first sighting, I called my husband from the very next truckstop.				0	2	7.3	73501	0.0000104	flying_saucers	0.00261324	0.050223117

19960820	19970104	West Manchester, OH	disk	5-10 min.	SUMMARY:  Teen girl  saw circular UFO with orange,green,reddish-orange .A series of rectangular windows were around the middle body. One window in the center moved down.The round bottom displayed a metallic gold color. She viewed it from30ft.for 5-10 min. before it zig-zagged and shot up into the sky.I was facing north an object appeared to be hovering over a group of power lines in my backyard near a ten foot tall shed. When I saw the UFO, I felt as if I was being watched and I watched for about 5 or 10 minutes. I felt very scared  and I felt as if something drawed me outof my house. When I got outside, I saw this. (drawing will be sent later) I saw the window marked &quot;x&quot;    move open as if something was opening it. The window seemed to move  down like rolling down a car window. Teen states that at 2:15 on 8-20-1996 she was making frozen french fries and she felt drawn to go outside. She states that she never goes around back at night , but something drew  her out thereand when she looked up  she saw an object about 10 feet away  and 10-115ft. above her.&quot; well the object was really low and I saw alot of windows and appeared as if someone or something was opening it. But anyway, I nver believed in UFOs until recently. Anyway, the object was circular and the lights on the !UFO was orange, green, and reddish-orange color, but the bottom was a goldish metallic color which was a round shape. Anyway, I watched the object for a good5 or 10 minutes and then I went inside looked out the window and the object was still there but then it zig-zagged in a pattern and it was really fast and then it was gone! Then I went to bed aat about 2:45, it started about 2:15, &quot; as stated in writing by (name deleted) on August 20,1996. Note: I saw her the morning after she witnessed this and the first words out of her mouth were ,  I saw a UFO in my backyard last night. I have known her for about ten years as a neighborand I coukd tell something had happened to upset her. I sat with her and ner sister in my backyard for the day trying to calm her and asking her to write down what happened and to draw if she could the object. After a long day together she calmed down after talking about her experience. I must include that a Deputy Sheriff had been dispatc!hed to our town to look in a nearby woods after a sighting of 8 UFOsby her brother less than two weeks before. We tried to tell him what happened to her, but he didn&apos;t act interested. He just wanted to let me know he had checked out the woods at my request to the Sheriffs office and found nothing. He advised we find out who owns the woods so no one would possibly file a trespassing complaint on us for entering the woods about a week after the event became known. I checked with our County Courthouse Records and found a number of possible owners. I called each one to ask about ownership. A woman north of town told me the owner. I called the Sheriff&apos;s office back to let them know I had the owners name and then I called to get permission to reenter the woods for my husband to look around. There were some trees down in the woods, but it looked like someone had notched them out before they fell. There is an area in the woods that has a circular patch where no vegetation grows. It is barren. I had my family take pictures while in there , but when the!film was developed some prints  were lost.I still have some pictures of the teen boy standing at the end of the street and pointing to the woods he saw  light up red and where all the Ufo activity took place as described in a report filed to the Nat&apos;l UFO R.C. as having happened on Aug. 7,1996, The reports being filed with the Center for Aug. ,Sept., and Oct. 1996 by me  will include a map and drawing for each sighting as soon as I can redraw the original from my files. I am submitting a video for the Center to review for the events that happened on Oct.18,1996. I am trying to get that tape ready to mail this weekend 1-04-1997 and will include the written report to you as soon as possible using your very handy on-line report form.Thanks so much to all of you there for helping us here in Ohio with all the problems we are encountering here of late in our backyards and over our houses.Take Care all of you and a special thanks goes to Mr Gribble, not Gripple. Please excuse my wro!ng pronunciation of your name. You should have corrected me. Thans not only for the time and trouble to look at and have analyzed the video tapes  I&apos;ve been sending , but for having founded the Center in the first place. I&apos;m only sorry to have been such a troublesome part of your life in 1996, maybe I can help in the future by filing things electronically now. Thanks again to all of you so much for your help and to Mr. Davenport, I ask you to forgive me for calling in at pesky hours of the morning. I am sorry for any trouble I have caused any of you there . All I can say is that I didn&quot;t mean to.

Young man called to recount his sighting of a &quot;ball of blue light.&quot; He was looking at the screen of his computer, and looking out into the backyard of his home at the same time.  He saw a flash of blue light, which looked like a &quot;bubble of light.&quot;  He estimates that it was at least 1/4 mile distant, and it could have been as far as 3 miles distant, since that is how far away the edge of the valley in which his home is located is. The bubble of light seemed to the observer to have a 3-dimensional quality to it.

A meteorologist for the National Weather Service called to enquire whether there had been any other reports about a burning orange light in the southern sky.  It was about 65-75 degrees above the horizontal plane, and he wondered whether it could have been the space shuttle. It appeared between broken clouds.  It was brighter and larger than a bright star, and smaller than the moon.  He said that if a person had seen it, he could not have missed it or mistaken it for a naturally occuring object. Its color looked like the orange (?) swirling flames that come out of the space shuttle when it takes off. He added that he was looking through broken clouds that were drifting, but he had the distinct impression that the object was moving.

Object was VERY fast, vastly faster than a fighter jet would fly.  Also, object was VERY bright. The object left a distinct trail behind it, which dissipated rather quickly. Viewer felt the object almost certainly was not a meteorite.  It maintained the same shape, same brightness throughout the sighting.  At first, he thought the object was a crashing aircraft.

SUMMARY:  Blue light faded to red with electrical sounding hum and then repeating.The light traveled from behind our home to the side lighting the interior.I am a 40 year old mother of three,my husband is 35.My husband and I had just retired to the bedroom for the evening. As we lie there a bright blue light coming from the backyard lit the entire ceiling of our bedroom. As quickly as it came it faded only to be followed by a red light of the same intensity. Along with the lights was an electrical sounding hum.These lights repeated but now on the side of our home leaving the backyard in total darkness.There wasn&apos;t a power outage in our home because none of the digital clocks were affected. It was snowing at the time but I am unaware of any type of unusual weather occurances that could produce such an effect. Also transformers are not located anywhere in the vicinity of the lights had one blown. A neighbor having seen the same lights at the same time, from across the street experienced a power outage on that side of the street for four hours following the incident.				0	3	6.9	430055	0.0000182	alien_abduction	0.008576329	0.012752647

19930812	19970131	Lake of the Woods (Near; closest city Ashland - 30 mi.), OR	light	30-45 min	SUMMARY:  3 luminous objects moving extremely fast, instant directional changes, changed colorMy parents and I were observing the Perseid meteor shower in a winter recreation site.  We decided to go there because it was very dark and it was basically a large field in which we could park our pickup.  We had binoculars and a mid-size telescope with us.  As we were watching the meteor shower, we all noticed moving, starlike points which changed color from white to red.  There were 3 such objects, and they appeared to be at an extremely high altitude (at least where commercial aircraft would fly).  They were mostly directly above us or at least 3/4 up from the horizon.  We were not certain of their altitude since there were no reference points.  Through binoculars the objects appeared to be executing extremely high-speed maneuvers (looping and passing close to one another) and they could accelerate or turn VERY quickly.  The telescope was impossible to use while viewing the objects because of their speed.  There is no way these were planes, helicopters, meteors, or flyin!g insects like fireflies (there are no fireflies that change color or live west of the Rockies).  I have no clue about what they were.  I would like it if someone e-mailed me regarding this, if it&apos;s possible.				0	0	1.1	0	0.0000138	alien_abduction	0.004085802	0.021414822		
19961030	19970222	Richmond, OH	triangle	a few minutes	SUMMARY:  orange triangle metallic looking object sighted from windowI was sitting on couch and saw a plane? coming in the distance. No surprise since I can see many planes coming and going on the horizon from the Pittsburgh airport on clear nights. We have a good view of open skies on the hill and have watched little meteorite showers in years past. This orange light was coming west it came so close and descended heading north.  I thought it was a plane crashing to the groud a few miles from my home.  It changed angles as it turned and it appeared as a metallic bottom with a glowing orange haze.  At each point there was a bright colored light. As I ran out the front door to witness the crash I saw it quickly change direction and ascend toward the east.  It disappeared from sight at a high rate of speed.  I think it was some weird new stealth like plane or a UFO. I was alone when it happened. I&apos;m married and have a career and I don&apos;t want to be known as a nut. As I was searching the web to see if anyone else witnessed my siting I discovered y!our site.  Everyone I know was indoors at that time and I really don&apos;t want to ask my neighbors for obvious reasons. I&apos;ve done alot of soul searching on whether I should report this in any way and so here I am. If there&apos;s someone else out there I want them to know that I saw it too.  I know how I feel.  If it crashed I would have drove off to see it but since it didn&apos;t- I probably will never know what it really was that I saw. It happened all so fast.

19960618	19960618	,			Young man was driving on East Business Route, I-80, in Sacramento.  He noticed an object, which at first looked like a conventional aircraft, but it had four white lights.  He could not see any shape to the object, even though it was moving toward the observers, and a bit to the right. The object looked like it was in a landing mode, very low, but there is no airport in that area.  The object then rolled to one side, and suddenly they could see it.  It then descended into a nearby neighborhood.  It did not move like a conventional aircraft. They drove toward the object, but they lost sight of it because of nearby trees.  They returned to the highway, hoping to see it, but it was no longer visible. I gave the caller the telephone number for Ruben Uriarte.				0	3	6.9	430055	0.0000182	alien_abduction	0.008576329	0.012752647

19961030	19961101	Kokomo, IN		2302	Young girl and male friend were sitting in a car facing south, when they saw two lights in the sky.  There were two solid, white lights, one on each side of the object, and a flashing red light in the middle.  They had the impression that the light was approaching their position slowly. As the object drew closer to them, it appeared to move slightly to the viewers&apos; left, then to the right. The viewers felt that the object, at its closest, was perhaps 200 yards &quot;in the air.&quot;  The young woman rolled down her car window to see if she could hear anything, and detected a high-pitched squeal.  The object was diamond shaped, and it appeared to have some kind of light in back.  Also, they could perceive visually that the object was not just &quot;beams&quot; (?) because it appeared to have a solid mass to it. The craft passed directly over their car, and it was heading to the northeast.  When they looked behind themselves approximately 5-10 seconds after it passed overhead, they could no longer see the object. The object appeared to the observers to be as big as a clenched fist at arm&apos;s length! She saw a UFO before, probably in 1990.  I gave the caller our address.

19740801	19970110	Campbell, CA	triangle	12 seconds	SUMMARY:  Sighting of a pair of triangular UFO&apos;s over the SF Bay Area,  August 1974In the summer of 1974,  I saw a pair of triangular objects while stargazing with binoculars.  At the time,  I assumedthat they must have been aircraft.  But it&apos;s been a long time since then,  and I haven&apos;t ever seen any airplanes,or whatever, that even remotely resemble the objects I saw.I have just recently gained access to the Web,  and being amused by UFO stories,  I found my way to a couple of theUFO pages.  While browsing at Rutgers,  I ran across some reports of &quot;triangular UFO&apos;s&quot;, which made my hair stand on end.  Up to that time,  I had not heard of &quot;triangular&quot;UFO&apos;s.  Here&apos;s what I saw in late August, 1974 while Iwas in the backyard of my house in Campbell, CA (South SFBay area).I was laying on the ground, looking through a pair of 20 power binoculars.  My feet were pointed east, and the binoculars were pointed slightly to the right of straight up,  at about the one o&apos;clock position.  Something went through my field of vision, moving right to left.  I caught up to it quickly,  and saw two objects flying in close  formation,  one behind and to the right of the one in front.They were both the same size, shaped like equilateral triangles with straight edges,  flying point forward. Their color appeared to be flat slate grey,  against a deep blacksky.  There were no features, and I saw no lights, or glow of any kind.  They appeared to be illuminated by the citylights.  It looked something like this:left (north)-                       .if this diagram doesn&apos;t-             -                .line up, select a fixed-                  -             .font (like courier).

The craft in front appeared more steady than  the trailing one, and the distance between them fluctuated randomly,  varying from nearly touching, to a maximum of a triangle length.  When the rear one began to lag,  it would suddenly snap back to a comfortable distance from the front one.  My impression was that it looked as though they were being manually controlled by pilots, and as if they had very high power to weight ratio, and like they were somewha thard to control.I watched them for about 8 to 12 seconds.  During that time,they maintained a due north heading, and covered about 80 to 90 degrees of azimuth.  After I lost sight of them,  I waited for several minutes for any sound.  I heard nothing.The binoculars were 20x50, with a field of view of 157 fee tat 1000 yards. If you assume that the objects were about 100 feet long,  and took up about 1/3 of the field of view, then their altitude would be 2000 yards, or 6000 feet, and their speed would be 568 mph.  That seems pretty conventional,but I think I would have heard jets at that altitude.Furthermore,  what jets have a perfect equilateral sillouette?The closest thing I can think of (that would be flying in 1974),is the B58 Hustler.  But my view was clear enough,  that I could have seen the little bit of fuselage in the front and backof the delta wing.I probably blew the simple geometry I used for the altitude and speed calculations,  but I&apos;ve given enough facts that one could calculate height and speed for any craft of a given size.((NUFORC Note:  As the reader probably has noted, the formation did not survive the transfer from our e-mail program to our website.

19960527	19961206	Amargosa Valley, NV	light	1hr	SUMMARY:  Friend and I witnessed &quot;flare like objects&quot;hovered more than 10 minutes per.Obj&apos;s #ing above 20. Strange person(s) watched us.On the way back from LV at approximately 20:30 hrs myself and a good friend were just driving down the road when we noticed a light in the Eastern sky.  We stopped the car and watched for a moment.  At first wethought they could be flares, then we noticedthat they were acting quite strangely.  Not intelligent type of movement, but they were staying up there for quite some time.  They were almost stationary for about 3 minutes in the skFriend and I witnessed &quot;flare like objects&quot;hovered more than 10 minutes per.Obj&apos;s #ing above 20.  Strange person(s) watched us.Then they started thier slow decent. When I say slow, I mean it took them 7 minutes to come down aproximately 100yds.That is the thing that intrigued us the most.We could see a visible trial of smoke as ifthey were flares, but they were much brighter and acted in a way that neither of us couldjust dismiss as something that was normal.They very well could be just flares and we don&apos;t know anything. But I am very good atj udging distance, adn have very good eyesight. I also feel that I am a UFO skeptic even though I am very intrigued. I don&apos;t believe that they were necessarily extraterrestrial space craft, but they were notjust a simple flare or &quot;plasma displacment&quot;.They could have been a number of different things. We have both tried to come up with explinations of the event and truely believe that that would be some what difficult toachieve. The way that they decended was thefact that forced us to come to that conclusion. It was a straight fall. But tookway too long to be a &quot;fall&quot;. It was aided bya rocket type of engine more than likely. Ifthat is so, it would more thatn likely havegone up, or been a little bit more eratic.The light was at first RED. When it startedto make it&apos;s &quot;fall&quot; it turned almost WHITE.I would very much appreciate it if someone would respond and tell me that theyknow what it is. And I hope that this willnot be taken like a &quot;stupid person reportinga light in the sky that is more than likelyjust a flare or a normal aircraft.&quot; As I havesaid; I do not think that it is alien. ButI felt that it is not something easilyachieved with any normal flare gun.NUFORC NOTE:  Location of sighting reported as &quot;just north of Amargosa Valley on State Route 95.&quot;	Imvite Airport	2.468050472	167628	2.358672863	3	6.9	430055	0.0000182	alien_abduction	0.008576329	0.012752647

The center portion of the wedge was all black, or dark, and was not visible.  No blinking lights on the object.  Observer estimates that the overall length of the object was 200-400, although he recognizes that it would be very difficult to estimate its length accurately.  His impression was that it was not very high, perhaps a couple hundred above ground level.  It appeared to be flying to the southwest.  He got our number from the Hillsboro, OR, airport.

Also, the callers said they went to get binoculars to look at the object. (Note:  That does not seem to make sense.

19961212	19961221	I-10, Marker 174, NM		7 min.	A professional trucker witnessed a brightly lighted object crossing the sky.  At first, he thought it was an aircraft, but it suddenly became stationary.  At that point, he realized that the light was in fact two separate lights.  They split apart, one going to the left, and the other west straight up.  The light that had gone to the left came back around his truck and paced the truck on the left side.  Then the object pacing his truck went straight up and joined the other object, at which point they streaked off.  The object paced the caller&apos;s truck for 5-6 miles, he thought.Other trucks must have seen the objects, the caller stated, since the CB came alive, and perhaps 30-40 trucks, he estimated, were talking about the objects.  The caller had kept time, mileage, and fuel records, and all of them were normal. He commented that he had not awakened his wife during the sighting, and she was upset with him.				0	3	6.9	430055	0.0000182	alien_abduction	0.008576329	0.012752647

19960224	19960224	Glendora, CA		2 min.	Two police officers were sitting in their police cruiser, looking west, while they talked with their shift sergeant. They noted a very bright, &quot;reddish-yellow ball with a firey tail,&quot; in the night sky to the west of their position, passing from right to left.  From the driver&apos;s seat, the object passed from the center of the windshield to the post on the left of the steering wheel.  Then, it appeared to be traveling to the east, when viewed through the side window.  At some point, the brilliance of the object subsided, and the tail disappeared from sight. However, it quickly appeared to make a second 90 degree turn to the south, at which point the tail &quot;ignited&quot; again, creating an appearance of a &quot;halo.&quot;  From this point, the observers watched the object going away from them for 5 seconds, or so, at which point it simply disappeared from sight.

They live approximately 10-12 miles northwest of Jackson, OH, on a county road, which is in the flight zone for Wright-Patterson AFB.  On Tuesday, 04JN96, he was dressing to go to work at about 2200 hrs., when he heard a roaring sound--like a C--47 aircraft--go overhead, apparently flying from east to west.  His daughter raced out of the house in time to witness the object, and reported that the object had green lights down one side of it, and white lights were trailing it. The next night, they experienced a somewhat similar incident.  The daughter saw the object again, and reported that it had &quot;little planes&quot; around the main object.

Woman was driving east from Barre, VT, and saw &quot;a cluster&quot; of very bright lights apparently hovering to the east of her position eastbound on the highway out of Barre.  The closer to her property she got, the more alarmed she became that the objects were near, or above, her property.  Just at the moment she pulled off the highway to go up her driveway, she witnessed an immense flash, that illuminated the countryside with white light.  At the same instant as the flash, she saw a streak of light shoot across the sky.  It was not clear to her whether the streak was from an object ascending from ground level, or whether it had come over the horizon, from behind the hill on which her farm is located.  She immediately drove down the road, in some state of alarm, to talk to her neighbor.  The neighbor had seen the flash, and the both of them stood outside and looked at &quot;red and blue flashing&quot; lights in several points of the sky.  (Note:  Were those lights twinkling stars??)

The caller, with two male friends, was driving west on Highway 518, and they had their heads outside the passenger&apos;s window, looking at the aircraft landing at Seatac airport.  They observed three bright lights in the sky, with the approximate brilliance of stars, but they were distinct in appearance, and they were oriented in an isosceles triangle pattern.  The lights exhibited no wing lights, strobes, beacons, or any other light which would be characteristic of aircraft.  The caller is a student pilot, so she is rather familiar with what aircraft look like, and what their lighting patterns are. Suddenly, as all three of the observers were looking at the pattern, they noticed a fourth light, which had suddenly appeared.  The caller will submit a written report.

19640915	19961225	Arcade, NY	disk	sec. to min.	SUMMARY:  Several sitings in the area of rt 98 and Bray road. One saucer-shaped, silent, dull-metallic appearing object travelled over downtown Arcade headed nw about treetop height.Seen by many. Nellie Daully(town operator) receieved many reports.Late summer/early fall before dusk.Object as described passed over town headed in general direction of thr park (nw).The year was probably 1964 or 65-66.I was a toddler but distinctly recall the object passing overhead dissappearing beyond the treetops in the distance. My mother witnessed this, and my sister(3yrs older)-but sister doesn&apos;t recall.The area was a hotbed of activity in the 60&apos;s. My father a physician and formerly, an airforce pilot during Korean war recounts that many of the sitings corroborated ufos generally travelling northbound following rt98. Bray road is one of the highest elevations in the county and people living there and in the area of Lost Nations witnessed several objects. One physician Dr. Oestriche (now deceased) saw lights back in the field and found circular depressions when he investigated the next day. Krueggers, who still live there have mentioned seeing things also. It was so common and widespread knowledge, that people used to park up and do!wn Bray Rd. to ufo watch. The last I&apos;ve heard is that there is a dome shaped building 1/2 way up Bray rd. which is under 24hr guard. Even the farmers next door to it don&apos;t know why it&apos;s there. I hope this old archival info may be useful. It is definitely truthful and deserving of scrutiny. One other point (of potential interest) is that Arcade is pretty rural-about one hour south of Buffalo; the only other interesting thing of note in the vicinity is the West Valley nuclear facility (about 15 miles south ). This was being built in the early 60&apos;s.((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD))	Arcade Tri County Airport	0.500055153	0	0	0	1.1	0	0.0000108	flying_saucers	0.212121212	0.000721848

I believe every word of it and my mother is honest and has no reason to lie to me. My mother was driving to work at about 6:00 o&apos;clock in the morning.  We live in a small town in the country, and off a few hundred feet from the road(a small country road) she saw several blue lights in a perfect circle on the ground.  The object was trapped by 3 helicopters and 2 more were coming in she said.  She did not want to stay because she was afraid the government would take her or something.  Where this occurred was about 150 miles from Diass Air Force Base in Abilene.  The reason why she is not telling you this is because she died 3 years ago.

It was just above the Olympic Mountains, and they viewed it with a 30-power spotting scope. It looked black, very long, shaped like a missle with a very pointed nose, and it was very prominent because it was giving off a large &quot;smoke plume trail.&quot;  They watched it for 5 minutes, when suddenly it dipped its nose down, descended, and disappeared behind the Olympic Mountains.NOTE:  Could the time of 1750 hrs. be wrong??  It should be 1850 hrs., to conform to the other sighting from Whidbey Island.  Check notes and tape recorded message.

19941101	19961226	Lower Lake (Near), CA	disk	10 minutes	SUMMARY:  &quot;The Dunn sightings&quot;  Two hunters parked at the end of a fire trail near the highest point in the area observed a bright white light in the distance. Suddenly the light shot up to high altitude instantaneously, then came directly at them. Passed at a slight tangent to them but was clearly visible. A perfect saucer shape, with bubble center surrounded by a white gas that gave it a haloed effect. 400-500 ft up, 1/4 mile distant.Filled a 3X9 scope.  the entire event lasted from 10-15 minutes.These two brothers have hunted the entire area and are familiar with it all.Sitting in their truck above the McLaughlin Gold Mine, where one was employed, they could observe the entire skyline for many miles from the ridgetop.The glow from the lights at the mine was visible below them.  In the distance they both noticed a bright white light.They both thought it was the light from a helicopter coming to the mine as happened occasionally.They watched it for approximately ten minutes when suddenly it literally &apos;jumped&apos; up to a much higher altitude and then proceeded to come directly at them.This was their first sighting and they both describe the event as extremely frightening!They thought the object was coming for at them specifically and they were in a panic.It came at them and veered to a slight tangent from a northwesterly direction.As it got closer they could clearly see the object as it passed within 1/4 mile at an altitude of 400-500 feet.It was a perfect saucer shape with a bubble in the middle and what appeared to be windows in the bubble.The light turned out to be a white gaseous appearing cloud that surrounded the entire craft but did not obscure it in any way.It filled the entire viewfield of a 3X9 variable scope.  The gas formed a halo appearance and no other lights were visible.But it was bright enough from a long distance to be clearly visible beyond the mine lights glow.It flew to the south west passing over Mt St Helena and then turned directly west toward the ocean.Note:  Almost a year later these two men witnessed another sighting of a completely different craft at another location in Lake County.This sighting lasted almost 5 hours.Additionally only a few months ago,(fall 96), they witnessed a strange phenomena on the ground near the location of the first sighting.Described as a &apos;puddle of soft black metallic shavings, maggot-like but not easily described- moving as if a magnet were being passed over themand seeming to grow before their eyes as if feeding on the landscape.They report it looked like something out of a science fiction movie!It was late morning.  One of the brothers walked right up to it.  It was a drizzly day.The object appeared at first to be shiny black water. As the younger brother,(30&apos;s) approached it, the older one had a bad feeling.He told his brother not to get near it and as it seemed to be growing they ran to their truck and left.Another trip to the area will be made soon.Since this materials was in an open area near a ridgetop, we hypothesize it to be some sort of spill,byproduct or waste material from an unknown vehicle or craft. Perhaps fuel related.They kept these sightings to themselves out of concern fror what others might think until I told them about this internet site and they agreed to be interviewed.I will further describe the next sighting in another report and this and the ohter will be labeled the &quot;Dunn&quot; Sightings.				0	0	1.1	0	0.000016	alien_abduction	0.008344924	0.015727535

Her impression was that the light emanated from a beam, or shaft of light, rather than from a point source.  There was no sound of thunder, and the sky was totally clear.  She awoke her husband, but the display did not occur again after her husband awoke.  The cat, she reports, reacted to the light.The caller and her husband own two businesses in the North Bend area, and they both are responsible people.

19961125	19961126	Monterey, CA		4 min.	Man called to say that he had had an urge to return to the same place, where he and his daughter had had a sighting on 26OC96.  He was talking on his cellular telephone with a MUFON investigator (Los Gatos, CA), when he witnessed a formation of three cylinder-shaped objects, in a triangular formation, fly directly over his head, and then split and fly in 3 different directions.The observer described this sighting in detail to the MUFON investigator over his cellular telephone at the time it was taking place. Approximately 3 minutes later, he witnessed eight more identical objects, described to be cigar-shaped and distinctly orange in color, streak overhead. The MUFON investigator recommended the caller get off the telephone, call someone else, and have a second observer come to the sight to see what he was observing. The observer called his wife, who arrived at the cemetary where the observer had seen the first two groups of objects.  They stood for an hour longer, but saw only one other object, that reportedly went overhead to the west into Monterey Bay.  The shape of this oject was not discernible to them.					3	6.9	430055	0.0000182	alien_abduction	0.008576329	0.012752647

19960811	19970106	Owen Sound (Canada), ON	light	approx 1/2hr	SUMMARY:  Objects began moving in a snake like motion (s&apos;ing) around the stars.I was out on my balcony enjoying a nice cup of coffee with my wife and her two sisters. I am an avid star gazer. I was watching the clear night sky up above.....just lost in itsbeauty. We were outside for about an hour, just talking aboutthe good times. I was looking up at the stars, when an unusually bright group of stars caught my eye. At first I thought it might be orion......then thought they might be satellites....but was quick to change my mind. They objects were very high up...too high to be planes. They began moving in a snake like motion(s&apos;ing)around the stars. This motion convinced me temporarily that they were satellites.....but then they stoped......grew very bright,and changed opposite direction. We were all quite with amazement at what we had witnessed. We stood out there discussing the rational possibilities of what it was that we had seen. As we looked in the direction of where the incident occured......we noticed a slightly larger grouping......of 7. They repeated thesame motions that the previous 3 had...then grew bright, almost joining in a straight line of light, then reversed course as theothers before had. We are still not sure of what we had witnessedthat summer night.....and have not discussed it with others....but I&apos;m certain what we witnessed was not of human origin or of Earth&apos;s current technology.  I am currently a college student, studying to be a computer technician and engineer. I am also interested in working for N.A.S.A when I havecompleted my education. I&apos;m 24 yrs old.I hope I am taken seriously.....this is the first time I have spoken about the incident to anyone.				0	3	6.9	430055	0.0000182	alien_abduction	0.008576329	0.012752647

19950831	19960323	Reno, NV			Sometime in August 1995, he believes, the caller arose to go to work.  He went outside his residence to start his car, when he looked in the morning sky and observed one peculiar light, larger than the moon, hanging in the sky.  Then, he realized there was not one, but two of them.  They looked like round balls of light with different colors around them.  There appeared to be a square-looking object, which he interpreted to be a &quot;door.&quot;  Then he could see, he thought, something dark underneath the bright light.  The dark object appeared to be saucer-shaped, and black. He got video footage of the object(s), which was aired on Channel 8 in Reno.He will send written report.

19970225	19970225	Boiling Springs (outside of, traveling on highway), PA		15 sec. approx.	SUMMARY:  Observed unidentified object apparently following AirlinerMy four year old son and I were returning from shopping at approximately 1420 hrs. EST. I observed a commercial aircraft at altitude, traveling in a westernly or northwesterly direction.  I was initially attracted to this as the commercial aircraft was trailing a beautiful con trail.  I took my eyes off the aircraft several times as I was driving, but I continued to glance up at it intermittantly, and suddenly I observed another object following behing the first aircraft at what I would estimate at under 1 mile, although I cannot be certain of exact distance.  First observed second object as it began to glow brightly as if the sunlight were glaring off of it.  Second object appeared behind and just outside of con trail at what appeared to be same altitude and speed, and traveling in same direction.  Found it somewhat puzzeling that there was no sun glare off of first aircraft, and also that there was no con trail from the second object even though it appeared to be at same a!ltitude and airspeed as the commercial aircraft.  Also, this second aircraft seemed to be following much closer than any I&apos;ve ever witnessed within the local flight corridors.  With the recent events concerning military aircraft closing on commercial aircraft from behind and triggering the commercial aircrafts anti-collision warning system, and it struck me as being rather odd that these two were reletively near one another in flight to not have such systems activate.  I observed the second object for about 10 or 12 seconds as it appeared to reflect the sunlight, it then stopped reflecting light and the glare stopped, and I continued to see an obhject but could not determine shape.  Within a few seconds of the glare from the sunlight reflecting off the second object had ceased, I lost sight of the 2nd object.  I continued to observe the first aircraft and it&apos;s con trail as it flew off into the distance.  The best I can estimate, the first aircraft was approximately over or nea!r Gettysburg at the time I made this observation.  I&apos;m sorry to say that I did not observe any unusual flight characteristics such as phenomenal or unusual speed or course deviations.  When I stated a commercial aircraft I was inferring larger sized, it may have been a large military aircraft I suppose.  I just found it unusual that  one of two objects that were apparently at the same altitude and speed, one reflecting sun and one not, and with one apparently following the other, one with a con trail and one without, was a bit &quot;unusual&quot; especially considering there relative distance of seperation!  It&apos;s probably nothing, but thought you&apos;d like to see the report, perhaps someone else has reported something else that will make further sense to someone there.				0	4	7.7	403014	0.0000193	alien_abduction	0.001768868	0.037098609

19961213	19961216	Detroit, MI		10 min.	A woman called to report that she and her three children had been driving, when they saw three lights in the sky.  They were very bright, and formed a triangular pattern. The mother continue driving past their house to &quot;get to it.&quot;  All of a sudden, the three lights went shooting off in different directions. They chased one of the lights for approximnately 12 minutes.  They &quot;caught&quot; one--it was in front of them--and then the son said it was suddenly in back of them.  She caught a second craft, perhaps the same one they had first caught, and they got out of the car.  Her son at this point said that the object was not a conventional aircraft. The object was round, it had no wings, and was gray in color.  The lights they were looking at were &quot;underneath.&quot;  The mother saw white lights, but she could not saw if they were recessed, or not.  The mother became alarmed by the sighting, so much so that she was having difficulty getting the ignition key into the ignition.  Last year (1995??), she, her husband, and their son had seen another object at about Christmas time. The mother later asked her son what he had seen, and he drew something that looked like a stop sign.

She observed 5 contrails in the sky and heard some type of engine noise.  Then she spotted something that appeared to her to be a twin-engine aircraft in one area of the sky, and also a helicopter in the northwest area of the sky.  From her vantage point, they were on paths that would cross, or the aircraft might even have been on collision courses. Suddenly, and peculiarly, the sound emanating from the helicopter ceased!!  Then, she looked back at the other object, which she had taken to be a twin-engine aircraft, and it had a different appearance.  It now looked like a collection of what looked like &quot;slivers of metal in the sky.&quot;These objects, apparently several of them, were &quot;flipping and doing formation flying.&quot;  They did not appear to be going fast, their (angular) velocity slower than a commercial airplane, for example. The object(s) suddenly stopped moving, and they equally suddenly disappeared.  She called the local airport about the helicopter, presumably to inquire who was flying it, and what it was doing.

Observer is awakened  from a deep sleep by a most peculiar sound, goes to her window to look out, and spots a bizarre ship hovering near her apartment complex. It had lights on the front, red lights in back, and very bright light in the middle of it. It had both solid, and flashing lights. No rotors, like a helicopter would have had. She is very familiar with helicopters, since they fly over her living complex on their way to a nearby federal facility. The object moved toward the west to another buidlding, turned around, and came back to the area where she had first seen it. It was like no machine she has ever seen in her life.  It was somewhat difficult to see the object amid the lights, because they were so bright, but there appeared to be some body to it.

19781220	19961207	Huntington Park, CA	disk	20 min.	SUMMARY:  My Father and I watched a silver object, shaped like a diamond on its side.  It hovered overhead then slowly moved to the right, then down, then leftand then up, to form a complete square.  It hovered some more than shot diagonally up and out of sight.I was 14 years old at the time.  It was Christmastime, cause I rember sitting next to our tree watching television.  It was dusk, so there was still some daylight left.  My father was sitting in our kitchen watching the birds outside.  I heard him yell for me to come see something.  I went into the kitchen and sat next to my Dad.  He then pointed out thewindow, up into the sky.  &quot;Watch that silver disc up there,&quot; he said.  The objectI looked at was not exactly round, it was kind of a cross between round and oval.  It was really high up but you could still see it clearly.  The color of it was silver, not unlike the way some jets look today.   As I watched the silver disc, it slowly moved to the right and stopped.  Next it moved slowly down and stopped.  Now it moved directly left and stopped.  And the last move it made was up and stopped.   At the time, I don&rsquo;t remember being really amazed by it, I just thought it was&quot;kinda neat&quot; is how I think I put it then! (chuckle).  As we watched the silver disc just hover in the one spot, it suddenly shot really fast diagonally up and was gone!  Later that night, after I had gone to bed, something woke me up.  I didn&rsquo;tknow what, but I had this strange sensation (not unlike dreaming).  I was being drawn to the back of the house.  So I walked slowly to our back door and pulled the shade on the window.  Normally what I would see is the silhoutte of our backyard trees against the streetlamp.  What I saw instead was a hugh, bright, white, light!   The light was so bright it was blinding!   I was suddenly startled, like waking up from a dream. I hurtled the shade down and ran back to my bedroom!  It took awhile, but I finally fell back to sleep and to my knowledge, nothing else happened.  My Father owned his own agency.  Me, I was a sophmore at Huntington Park High School at the time.

19820515	19961208	West Reno (out on old Hwy 40), NV	other	1 minute	SUMMARY:  Loud boom, so loud shook house.  Went outside to see what happened.  Saw hole in sky cover perfect circle.  Moon in center of circle, full moon only 1/20 the size of hole.  Lots of neighbors witnessed too.  No aircraft or noises after that.Sitting at home in the evening, when a loud boom shook the house.  Maybe a sonic boom.  Not sure.  Ran outside with the curiosity of anyone my age (12) to see what had just happened.  Upon arriving outside, I saw a perfect&quot;cookie cutter&quot; round hole in the cloud cover.  The full moon was in the center of it.  The hole was HUGE!  The full moon was dwarfed by the circle in the clouds.  It is almost like something was there in the clouds and vacated immediately.  Didn&apos;t see any aircraft of any kind.  No lights or engine sounds.  I then noticed I was holding my pellet gun for protection and was also being watched by the  neighbors.  I felt out of place and went back inside.  I would very much appreciate any kind of response to this.  I feel like it was very important.  But I have just found some one to tell that can&apos;t really tell me that I am a nut, if you understand.  Did any one elsereport anything similar anywhere near thattime?   Could be one year off either side.  Could it maybe be explained as a natural phenomenon?   Either way, I would just like to rid myself of the curiosity of the whole event.((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the event is approximate.

The caller&apos;s partner called his attention to one object moving rapidly overhead, then they saw two more nearby.    While they were looking at them, one of the three orange discs--the one on the lower right-- streaked out of the formation, performed some rapid maneuvers for a short period of time, and then streaked back into the formation!! The observers could see stars behond the center of the triangular formation.  The caller sounded very sincere, and he sounded rather surprised by the sighting.  It was his first sighting of a UFO.

As I turned to look, it appeared to be an oval shaped blue glow just sittin there. Then it glowed a soft orange around the outer sphere and shot through a cloud bank, I could still see the bright glow through the hazieness of the cloud . faster than I could react, or say anything to anyone it was gone , just like that, no big production just flat gone! When I turned to my son who was standing next to me, he was already looking up at me. He asked me what the light was and I knew then that I was not seeing any sort of firework or pyrotechnics. It was flying at around the same altituide a commercial airliner would, but I&apos;ve never seen anything move so quick. And there was NO sound as it shot across the sky .				0	4	7.7	403014	0.0000193	alien_abduction	0.001768868	0.037098609		
19970510	19970512	Provo/Orem/Salt Lake City, UT	light	2 mins	Summary : Saw a white yellowish light performing vertical and horizontial maneouvers in the northern sky.  At one point it elongated itself and moved one point to another almost instantaneously.At 00:25 am on May 10, 1997, I was getting into bed and glanced out my bedroom window and noticed a large white &apos;star&apos; with a yellowish hue to it with a background of the black sky and other stars.   I remarked that I have never seen such a large &apos;star&apos; before.  It didn&apos;t twinkle as the other stars did, which make me even more curious.  Its shape wasn&apos;t circular, but rather more a square with concaved side.  (Discription of star shape:  Place a square on one its corners, and its axises both vertical and horizontial, take the circumferencial straight lines and cause them to become concaved towards the center-point where the axises of square meet. )  This was the shape of the &apos;star&apos;.After looking at the star for about ten seconds, it disappeard.  It reappeard several seconds later to the left of its original position.  The color had changed from the yellowish white to blueish white.  The size had also changed, it resembled more like a regular star size.  Intermittenly the blueish light would flash, although not at regular intervals.  Occasionally (two or three times), a small red light flashed (but not as frequently as the &apos;white&apos; light) This red light was also irregular in its flashing.  No blue light was ever seen as in regular aircraft lights.The light moved from its &apos;9 o&apos;clock&apos; position to the &apos;center of the clock&apos; position&apos; and immediately perform a 90 degree turn to the &apos;12 o&apos;clock&apos; position. in a fraction of a second.  There was no gradient climb from the &apos;9 o&apos;clock&apos; to the &apos;12 o&apos;clock&apos; positions, even in the other movements mentioned below.It remained for several seconds in the &apos;12&apos; position, and performed a vertical descent to the &apos;6 o&apos;clock&apos; position.  (No red light flashing)The light continued this movement between the above four points, but never, while I viewed it, move to the &apos;3 o&apos;clock&apos; position.At one point in its movements, from the &apos;9&apos; to the &apos;center&apos; positions, the object seemed to elongate itself and be at both positions at the same time for only a fraction of a second, and then repositioned itself  from the &apos;9&apos; to the &apos;center&apos; positions.I decided to get my video camera, and after a quick search of two rooms, found it and returned to the bedroom, but unfortunaltely the light was gone, so I did not get it on video.Total time was about a 1 minute to a minute and a half.				0	4	7.7	403014	0.0000193	alien_abduction	0.001768868	0.037098609		
19960815	19970314	Grand Rapids, MI	light	20 minutes	Summary : We saw two red dots of apparent unearthly origin.A friend and myself saw a small dot that was very hard to notice at first in the sky directly above us. We were star gazing.  It was very high and it was red.  It wasnt a sattalite or any conventional aircraft.  It would slow down and speed up and most oddly it would make turns of which i have never seen at the speed in which it appeared to be traveling.  After 20 minutes or so it disappeared over the treeline and the 10 minutes later it returned with a second object, also moving about oddly.  They both dashed about for a few minutes, going in triangle shaped motions, then eventually disappeared again, for good this time.  I have told many peopel this story and i was referred to this page by one of them, so there is my story.  I still dont know if it was a ufo, but thats what I believe it was.

19720601	19970714	Texas City, TX	light	3 /4 min.	My sighting was a long time ago and some details are hard to remember.One summer nite i was taking my sister to pick up some clothes from the garage of my parents house that had burned down .She was in the garage for some time and i had became restless and had laided my head on the car door from the inside of the car on the drivers side. Iwas looking up gazing at the stars it was a clear nite . Then out of no where a triangle formation of lighted dots drifted across the sky.There was no sound . If i had not been looking up i would have never seen this event.I was startled and amazed at what i was wittnessing .I had to move to the other side of the car very quickly because the dots of lights were moveing at a pretty good drift. The amount of dots or disk that i saw were between 12 or14  moving in a northeasterly direction.The lights did not stop or move in any wierd manner, they stayed on a straight path . Their color was like a white silver more whiteish sort of like a full bright clear moon. Idid tell my father and sister and mother about this sighting and fact on that nite i had also yelled at my sister to come and see but she was trying to get her clothes and didn&apos;t make it out in time to see . I have waited a long time to tell anybody else because most people think your crazy . I also didn&apos;t know where to report such a matter until i recently got on the net and found this site.

0	19970410	Near Randle, WA	light	45 Seconds	Summary : Large bright object moving horizontal in the evening sky, very low, made no noise.A friend and myself where viewing the comet Hale-Bop Saturday  April 5th  near the Cispus River in Lewis County WA we observed a object best described as a very bright light at a  very low altitude about  5,000 to 6,000 ft moving in a horizontal trajectory towards Mt. Adams at a speed faster then a jet but not at a streaking speed, both of us were able to run down the dirt road for about 200 yds while tracking the object across the sky. I have never seen anything like this in the sky. I have watched the skies for many years and what amazed us most, was that there was no sound at all, only frogs chirping. If this was a plane we would have heard jet sounds. I am a computer Instructor and my friend a painter what we saw that night is something we still cant explain. We hope to update our story as we will be going back up this week to hopefully see more and get some answers to our question.				0	0	1.1	0	0	None	0	0

19790701	19971223	Chico, CA	rectangle	4 - 7 minutes	Summary : A huge solid black mass, silently glided directly over us from the NNE going SSW then did a perfect 90 degree turn directly over us and went due E.  No lights, no sound, just a monstrous huge black vehicle.  My impression was it was like a rectangle.  We only new it was there because it was blocking out the stars (there were no clouds that night), that is what drew our attention to it, blocking out a large section of the sky and it&apos;s movement.  I have no idea how high it might have been although it was at least above 3500 feet.  Myself and my associates were all standing together talking when one of the guys said what is that coming from the &quot;North?&quot;  We all looked and then could make it out, it was awsome.  We were all &quot;on duty police officers&quot; taking a break in our favorite spot where the ambient lights of the city didn&apos;t block the stars.  The north valley is known for it&apos;s clear nights and fantastic views of the night sky.  If we hadn&apos;t been taking that break and watching the sky while we talked we would never have seen this object.  And no, I have not said anything before this time.  We all looked at each other and basically said &quot;what the hell was that thing!&quot;We were all Chico or Butte County Deputies at the time who often worked the same areas of the county/city together.  This location we were standing in was on a sight rise or hill on the SE side of town, leading up to the foothills of the Sierras.  It was away from public view where we could park four or five police cars, drink some coffee and relax for a few minutes without scrutiny or criticism from passing motorists; and the sky gazing was superb from that location. We were all veteran cops as well as military veterans.  I was a combat air-defense control officer in the military and have somewhat of a good idea of what anything man made can accomplish in the air.  This was not anything that we could possibly have built.  I don&apos;t know why I thought it was a rectangle, but I just had that feeling about it.  Whatever shape it was, it was huge!					2	8.5	563827	0.0000122	flying_saucers	0.000656599	0.066628751

She looked at it with binoculars, and the object appeared to be round, and it was tan and very bright, and it &quot;was moving fast.&quot; (??)  In her words, it looked like a &quot;flaming object.&quot;  The object passed out of sight over the mountains to the north.  ((Note:  There were discrepancies in the report.

It seemed tochange course slightly before disappearing,moving northwest.  This seems to have set itapart from meteorite or firework activity.See above for description.  (blue-green objectmoving east to west in southern sky overthe Alton, IL area at 9:45pmon July 4, 1997.)I&apos;d like to add that it was brighter than anyof the fireworks that neighbors were launchingat the time.  It lit up the yard for a moment --not brightly ... but, more so than moonlightor fireworks.  Slightly less than lightning.The fact that it moved so smoothly and quicklymade me think it was a shooting star ... a closeone because of the &quot;thickness&quot; of the trail.But, it shifted course a little, heading morenorthwest than west, which I found odd.  Thenit disappeared.think is odd.	G. Bray Airport	0.271898187	1735789	2.199358629	4	7.7	403014	0.0000193	alien_abduction	0.001768868	0.037098609

About three minutes later It again this time alot closer.  It had green lights on the bottom and it had a strange blue light going over the ground.  I was so scared that i could not move.  The light went by my house and then it turned off.  The ship then left and i sat there for another 20 minutes or so trying to figure out what hte hell i just saw.  I thought maybe it was a dream, but then my sister came out and asked me what that bright light was she saw out the window.  I now am convinced that it was a craft from another planet.This experience has been scary and interesting.  The only thing i left out in the descriptio above, is that i had a radio on and it started going crazy about 5 minutes before the first sighting.

In a couple of seconds, they merged together from their side-by-side formation in a curved V-shaped movement. The resulting light moved southwest at an amazing rate,where it disappeared beneath the horizon. I&apos;d say it moved from 70 degrees to 0 degreesin 20 seconds.

19970626	19970702	Wendover (approx. 20 miles E of Nv. I-80), UT	disk	35 sec.	Summary : Object flew towards us from S.E. and then parallel to us at 75 mph. Appox. 8 lights on outer circumference of disk shape, only lights visible.  Rotation of approx. 6 revs per minute.  Object disappeared when last visible light turned off. Lights were approx, 30 degrees apart on outer surface leaving times when only 3 lights were visible.  Light appeared to be coming out of portals.  Structure of object not visible, only rotating lights.Departed Salt Lake Airport by car at 2200 MDT on I-80 westbound at 75 mph toward Wendover, Nv. At 2305 driver saw what appeared to be two close, low flying aircraft, one seen as two lights and the other seen as one light approaching quickly from S.E.  Driver told passenger to look up to see jets.  No noise or visual above so driver looked to S. E. again to see the three lights now flying parallel to vehicle.  Now three lights could be seen to be rotating with more lights being added  from the one and the other two disappearing.  The lights were on the outer circumference of a disk and were rotating.  Rotation was approx. three revs during a 30 second visual.  After about 30 seconds, and into the third rev, while only one light was visible, this light went out and although we looked and looked for the lights, they were gone.  We never saw another thing.  I called HAFB to check on night aircraft operations and determined the 388 TFW was in the general area that night.  I also !checked with the Salt Lake Airport Authority and found that a movie was being filmed, using a helicopter with a camera pod below, outside Tooele, Ut., approximately 80 miles west of our sighting.  I still have not been able to correlate these activities with what we saw.The driver of the car has 33 years experience as an ((deleted)) engineer with a T.S. clearance and in general, with logic, tries to explain unusual occurances away. The other witness is a customer service agent with a major airline at the Salt Lake International Airport.

I looked up and saw a very distant (vertical distance) ,but it seemed that it was large , blue , hazy circle shape , off to the south. it was a color a little lighter than cobalt. It looked like it was staying still. My friends mom was on my deck and  i asked her if she saw that and she said yes. i asked my friend ,who was shooting off bottle rockets because i wasnt at the mom (ie turns), just as i said look at it and it sounded like he said yes , i looked away and then it was gone. it was way too high to be a firework, and way too bright to be a plane or helicopter, plus i couldnt hear any noise like that because my neighbors had stopped shooting off stuff for about 30 min. it was high enough that i couldn&apos;t tell if it was over St.Charles County,or over St.Lous County because we are very close.				0	4	7.7	403014	0.0000193	alien_abduction	0.001768868	0.037098609

She had gone to the park with her son, and she noticed a glint of sunlight off an object, which appeared to be high in the sky, which was clear.  The object was moving from SE to NW, and it was very small.  Its color was either white or silver. At first, the caller, an amateur  bird watcher, thought it might be a bird, but she could see no flapping.The object went in a straight path at first, and it exhibited no contrail, and there was no apparent sound.  Suddenly, the object began to turn, executing a 180 reversal of course in 5-10 seconds. The observer walked in front of a tree, losing sight of the object for a moment.  She called it to the attention of other people in the park, who saw it as well. The object reversed its directionb, and suddenly began to climb.  It accelerated, and disappeared in approximately 3 seconds, or so. She added that the object had exhibited three speeds:  slow and deliberate; it accelerated somewhat; and very fast. She called the Dane County Sheriff&apos;s office.	Wild Rose Idlewild Airport	1.008061679	662072	2.199358629	4	7.7	403014	0.0000193	alien_abduction	0.001768868	0.037098609

No sound.I saw this sometime after last Christmas (I washome from Boston University where i graduatedthis May with a BA in psychology) whilestanding on a friend&apos;s back porch in Hurst Texas,very near (roughly two miles NW of) the bellhelicopter plant.My friend was with me but did not see it.I noticed it in the western sky. It was a verybright white ball of light which shot straightdown much faster than i&apos;ve ever seen anythingshoot straight down.  I have no idea how largeit was, but would guess based on theintensity of the light that it was probablyno more than a mile or so away. It disapearedfrom view behind some trees to the west (probablyabout 25 degrees from the horizon where i wasstanding). I heard no sound during or after seeingit.  There was no flash or sound of an explosion,which I would have expected given its speed,trajectory, and apparent proximity when it disapearedfrom view.The sighting lasted no more than a second, but madean impression on me.  I never thought of reportingit until I ran across this web page.I hope it&apos;s useful.-((Name and e-mail address deleted))will only be active for another month or two.

19971115	19971122	Lockport, NY	sphere	25 minutes	Low in the eastern sky over a farming area I spotted a ball of bright light, every once in a while it seemed a ring of color would move around the the lower part of the object but it was too bright to tell any color. It was not moving and seemed to be at the same distance the whole time.  At one point it turned into a  bright orange ball the same size as the bight ball of light. Then a few minutes later back to the bright ball of light. I watched for about 25 minutes altogether.  Finally it turned back into the orange ball and quickly got smaller and smaller until it disappeared about 15 seconds later.  Someone told me that the faster it goes from large to small is the rate of speed it is traveling at. I know for sure now that there is something out there.

19970704	19970707	St. Louis, MO	light	1 sec.	Summary : Rapidly moving blue-green in sky over fireworks spectatorsOn the evening in question, I was in the crowd near the Gateway Arch waiting for the fireworks display to begin at 2140.  At approximately 2115, I was looking up at helicoptors that were moving around the river and immediate airspace over the city near the Arch.  At about that time, I happened to notice an object, moving at an extremely rapid rate through the sky, almost directly overhead. The duration of the event was so short that I thought that it might have been some kind of meteorite or something similar.  The object was bluish-green in color, like a streaking fireball in shape, and moving east to west at a speed much faster than any aircraft, flare, fireworks, or shooting star/meteorite I have ever seen before.  The light gave off no observable sound, nor was there some kind of sonic boom or anything of the sort. I commented on it to my friend who missed it and wasn&apos;t interested in my observation.  I overheard others in the crowd in my immediate area comment on the light, so I&apos;m pretty sure that there are others who can comment on seeing the light.  I am writing this, only because I happened to see a report in the news today about a similar series of observations across the river in Illinois.

19930605	19970403	Economy Borough, PA	triangle	30 mins +	Summary : Huge triangular shaped object.  Slow speed and low altitude.  Passed directley over my position. No sound except wind rushing past.  NE direction and never swerved, swayed, turned or changed speed. Light shown on ground, briefly.While coming home from working the 4-12 shift as a Police Officer, I noticed an &quot;airplane&quot; flying in the direction in which I was traveling.  After driving a few miles, I noticed that the &quot;airplane&quot; was still on it&apos;s course. It should have been far away by that time. I was curious, but soon forgot about it. As I was turning onto the final rode that leads to my housing plan, I noticed that the &quot;airplane&quot; was still there.The PLan where I lived was on the highest point in the area and as I got to the Plan, my visibility was practically unlimited except for some trees.  I could see the &quot;airplane&quot;better at this point and I suspected that it was a helicopter because of the slow speed.  The &quot;helicopter&quot; displayed a search type light at the ground and I thought it was a medical helicopter looking for a landing zone.  I&apos;ve seen helicopters do this in my capacity as a Police Officer, and I was worried that someone might have been badly injured in my neighborhood. While thinking these thoughts, the &quot;helicopter&quot; turned off the search light and continued in a straight line heading directly toward my housing plan.I hurried my vehicle to a point where I figured the &quot;helicopter&quot; would pass over, and I turned off my head lights. Then I shut off my engine and got out of the vehicle to get a better look at the &quot;helicopter&quot;. When I got out of the vehicle and looked up in the sky, I noticed that I was not looking at a helicopter, airplane, blimp or anything I could recognize.  I was looking at a triagular shaped craft with a light at each point, smaller lights were dotted underneath as this was my point of reference, and no strobe lights like a commercial aircraft would have.  The object made no sound, although it seemed to me that I could hear wind rushing past. Faintly, albeit.  The altitude was very low, a few hundred feet or less, and the speed was radically slow. The object was huge.the night was crystal clear and warm, and I saw it but can&apos;t believe what I saw.  It has taken me this long to report it.  I told this story to Mike Frizzell of the Enigma Project and he told me to write to you.				0	0	1.1	0	0.0000138	alien_abduction	0.004085802	0.021414822		
19970724	19970727	Murphysboro, IL	cylinder	Approx:5min.	Summary : The witnessed reported to me she saw a irradescent,green,cylindar object move horizontal across the sky going South to North. She first thought it might be a shooting star, but it was moving horizontal instead of vertical.  It was too low to be a plane and she didn&apos;t think it was one at all. It was consistantly in motion.  It streaked across to catch a glimpse and then just vanished out of sight. The whole sighting was appoximately 1 to 2 seconds.She was out on her deck by a pool at night.  She happened look up in the night sky and saw the irredescent green shape.  Temperature was normal for this time of year.  Humidity was low. Sky was clear. The shape was frisbee like.  Possessed no characteristics of a airplane.

19970102	19970629	Austin, TX	light	30 minutes	Summary : While viewing M42 through telescope, we witness 3 anamolous moving lights, two with scope, one with naked eye, approx. 10-15 min. apart.On the night of 1/2/97, at approximately 19:15, my husband and I were viewing M42 (in Orion) from our balcony through our 10&quot; Mead LX200, with a 6.7-mm eyepiece.The night was clear, and we had never seen such depth of color in M42 before - it was beautiful.  I witness a small (star-sized) orange light travel roughly east to west(top to bottom of eyepiece) in about 3/4 of a second.  I immediately looked at that area with my naked eye, as did my husband, but we saw nothing.  Approximately 10 minutes later,my husband was viewing M42 with a 15-mm eyepiece.  He, too, witnesses a small &quot;yellow-orange&quot; light, traveling at the same apparent speed - although he describes its movement as &quot;erratic&quot;.Again, our attempts at immediate naked-eye confirmation yield nothing.  We continue to observe M42 in the hopes that we will see another light.  This time, we alternate: oneviews through the scope while the other observes M42 with the naked eye - at this point, we have ruled out satellites (&quot;erratic&quot; movement of the second light) and insects flying in front of our lens(none observed with naked eye - lights are in focus through scope - lights are visually quite small).  Approximately 10-15 minutes later (19:45), my husband is viewing through the scope,and I&apos;m watching Orion like a hawk.  With my naked eye, I witness a white light, again visually star-sized, &quot;come out&quot; of the bottom star of Orion&apos;s sword, travel in a small curve or hook, and then travel at a visualangle of about 45 degrees.  It moves in a straight line until it is approximately under the right star of the belt, and it simply &quot;turns off&quot;.  This takes about 2 seconds.The previous night, my brother and his friend were over observing M42 and Betelgeuse (19:00) and reported seeing &quot;shooting stars&quot; through the telescope.  My husband and I are amateurastronomers, and have seen meteors, satellites, airplanes - all of the &quot;reasonable&quot; explanations.  These three lights do not fit in with those explanations.  We have attempted over the past few months to figure this out, but cannot.  I can only say that we both have had an unshakably strange feeling about these observations, and I decided that posting this sighting might bring other observers of this phenomenon to us.

19970808	19970820	Lynnwood, WA	other	16 minutes	Summary : Noticed object low and far in Western sky just north of setting sun. Object was round and did not move.Driving West Bound on 164th St SW (6th Ave W cross street)in Martha Lake area of Lynnwood, WA and noticed a bright round object in the setting sun light.  It looked far off in the distance like out over the Pacific Ocean.  It looked large.  It seemed odd that it was large enough to block enough of the setting sun light to be visible and to aparently twinkle (emit its own light).  Intreagued I watched it intently.  It did not move relative to the horizon or the setting sun.  I then turned south on 13th Ave W past ELDEC (Crane) Electronics and lost sight of the object behind trees.  I then kept driving and eventually got to the Target store at Alderwood Mall (184th and Alderwood Mall Blvd in Lynnwood) and the object was still there and had not moved in the sky and still looked the same in terms of the light being emitted and the ability of the object to be seen through the brightness of the setting sun.  I got out of my truck and observed the object for approximately 2 minutes! and said wow it just isn&apos;t moving.  I went into the Target Store at 9:22 pm and the object was still there.  I came back out around 9:45 pm and it was gone from the sky.  I was the only one to witness this-I was alone.  My background-Local person grew up here. ((Deleted)) Engineering degree from UW.  Worked in Construction Management for 6 years, as a engineer for a ((deleted)) company for a year and I am now a ((deleted)) engineer at ((Company and projects deleted)).

We were almost home, and as I was looking up at the sky I noticed an intensly lit object.  It was small, because it was at a pretty high altitude.  It looked like two balls attached to each other by a rod (i.e. O-O)  It moved around erraticly with apparently random course.  Then, it streaked off to the south at a speed faster than any airplane would ever be able to reach.  Then it was gone.  I didn&apos;t say anything to my mom, but in later years I have mentioned it to my brother.

19971216	19971217	Allison Park, PA	hexagon	3 to 4 minutes	Summary : A long hexagon shaped object crossed the sky just north of Pittsburgh,PA, with heading northeast and moving at a speed that I estimate to be around 50 knots.I saw the object cross the sky on Tuesday night(12/16) at around 7:55 PM EST. It was dark outside but the sky was complete clear except for stars(The moon was still below the horizon). I was looking out the window when I saw what appeared at first to be a low flying airplane, but the shape was odd. As it came closer I could tell it wasn&apos;t a plane so I grabbed a pair of binoculars from my closet and headed outside to take a look. By this time the object was coming directly over my house. It was a long hexagon shaped object with 6 large lights and several smaller illuminations. The two lights at the end points of the object were red, while the four lights that made up the center of the object were white. In the inner surface of the object were what looked like a smaller ring of lights, but the were very dim. These lights on the object were different from what a normal aircraft lights look like. First off, they did not blink. Second, the appeared diffused like the light from a LED, not the bright bulb type lights that you would see on a airplane. While the object was at a fairly high altitude I was able to see the actual body of the object. It was definitely a solid mass, hexagon in shape. I couldn&apos;t make out anything on the surface but it appeared to be a dark grey or black. The total time I could see the object was about 4 minutes. It didn&apos;t seem to be moving very fast but it velocity and direction were constant. The object also made almost no noise. I live 25 miles from Pittsburgh Intl. Airport so a lot of plane fly over head at a fairly frequent pace and you can hear the engine drone from miles away, but this thing made only a slight hum even as it flew away. If you would like a more in-depth description or drawing of what I saw let me know by e-mail and I can call or fax your office. I don&apos;t know if that makes any sense or not, or if you have had any other reports from the part of the country. I don&apos;t know what it was I saw but I can say for almost certain that it was not a airplane and not a blimp.

19900701	19970626	Fontana, CA	light	3 to 5 minutes	Summary : A bright light in the shy that seem like chopper&apos;s light however without any sound or movement.  The light disappeared into the sky after about two minutes.Back in 1990,  I was going home around 11:00 P.M. and witnessed a police car stopping a car while I was waiting for a signal light to turn green.  As I passed the police car,  I noticed a bright light above the police car at 60 degree angle and coming from a western direction.  At first,  I though it was a police chopper serving as a back up to the police car.  However, after looking at it for a couple of seconds I did not notice any characterisitcs of a chopper.  In other words,  the police chopper was not doing its typical circular patterns that is common to see when looking at a cop chopper, and it was not shining it&apos;s strong bright light on any thing on the ground.  A block later I got home and got out of my Jeep to find two neighbors looking at the object.  However, minutes later the bright light disappeared into the night sky.  Although, at the time I was a college student and it was a Saturday night,  I was not drunk or had any to drink that night.  I was sober and total!ly awake.

19970422	19970428	Spokane, WA	light	20 minutes	Summary : Large bright red light, size of Venus at its brightest, observed over Spokane, Wa. at 1:00 a.m. on April 22, for about 20 minutes. Appeared stationary, then moved slowly upward and disappeared. No sound. No apparent explanation.Large bright red (not orange) star-like light (at first described as &quot;Mars&quot;, but was not) seen in northern sky at about 30 degree angle, at 1:00 a.m., on April 22, 1997 in Spokane, Wa.. Too big to be a satellite, and not blinking or moving fast enough to be a plane or helicopter. (It would have been too low to be a plane without some sound.)  No sound accompanying this event.  Clear night.  Full moon.  Light as large as Venus might appear at its brightest, but &quot;stop-light&quot; red.  No other object that color in sky.  Only faint stars in that direction.  Appeared to be stationary, but with continued viewing seemed to very slowly move upward and between two distant stars, about 5-10 more degrees.  Then as I watched, it was just gone.

At about a 45 degree angle we observed a flight of ???? moving from left to right in a formation.Upon entering my driveway I observed some objects moving across the northern sky from left to right at about a 45 degree angle. They appeared to be in formation. Some of the were trailing sparks...looked kind of like a childs sparler used on the 4th of July. There must of been 6 to 10 objects. I live East of Olympia and South of Lacey in the country. It was very clear. We turned off the engines to the vehicles and could not hear the objects.

19970313	19970319	Prescott, AZ	formation	30 seconds	Summary : Saw 5 bright lights in triangle formation in the northand heading southeast at an extremely fast speed.Here&apos;s what I saw.  I was taking the dogs out before bed (I&apos;mnot exactly sure what the time was, around 2100 I think)and I looked to the north and saw 5 very bright white lightsin a triangle (or V) formation moving really fast southeast.Then they broke formation.  The light in the back and below(from my angle) slowed up.  Now I started to wonder what I waslooking at because most planes would keep formation or at leastbreak formation completely.  Never saw a plane with lights asbright as these also.  The group seemed to rotate 90 degrees tothe left and go a little south of Mingus mountain.  I was suprisedthat I couldn&apos;t hear them so I listened harder.  I did hear thesound of a faint rustling in the sky, not like a jet, but of somethinmoving extremely fast through the air.  The sound was a ways behindthem also and did seem to follow them.  I then started lookingaround at two other planes flying.  Sessna&apos;s by the sound andspeed of them.  Also by the red flashing lights.  I saw the lights fadeinto the distance and I headed back inside.  My first notion was whathas our government got up there?  New stealth technology?  Then whythe lights?  I also thought the lack of sound could have been some formof some top secret frequency cancellation system that the governmentis checking out.  But still, why the lights?It didn&apos;t hit home that these could possibly be UFO&apos;s until I heardpeople talking about it on Friday.  Then I knew I had seen somethingthat was definately unexplainable.  At least by me.It was definately not the comet, flair, balloon, or any other thing ofthat nature.Anyway, feel free to call if you want more information	Ernest A.

19940615	19971030	Lemoore, CA	triangle	5mins	Summary : I saw a large, triangluar shaped object with off-white lights at each corner slowing moving about 3-500 ft high in the sky.I believe that it was the summer of 1994. I was sitting in my patrol car at about 0300 hrs., when I noticed movement in the sky to the north. What I saw was a very large, triangular shaped object with off-white lights at each corner slowing moving from north to southeast. The craft could have only been maybe 300-500 feet high and there was absoulutely no sound coming from it. I watched in dis-belief and tried to make sense of it. I thought about the Stealth bomber, but wouldn&apos;t that at least make some sound? I could tell that this object was solid, as the middle of it darkened out the clear sky behind it. The lights seemed erie, not bright, but not dull, and they were steady, but also seemed to flicker. It took maybe two minutes for the craft to pass over me and as it began leaving my field of vision, I finally realized that I needed to follow it. I followed it for about another two minutes as it travelled southeast out of my city limits and Im not sure why, but I decided to stop my &quot;pursuit&quot;. I also am not sure why I didn&apos;t tell anyone about this incident until fairly recently, when I told my wife. I&apos;m a 15 year police veteran, who has seen alot of weird stuff late at night, but I&apos;ve never seen anything like this. There is a Naval Air Station nearby, but I&apos;ve been out there many times and as far as I know, they don&apos;t have anything like what I saw.

It seemed to appear from nowhere and disappear just as quickly. Elevation was rather low, about cloud level.At about 21:30 on the 4th of July several of us saw a bluish/green light just streak across the sky. It was only visible for 1 to 2 seconds but was moving very fast from an east to west direction. It appeared that the elevation was only about cloud high. It was moving so fast it was difficult to get a shape but reminded me of a tip of a flame from an aircraft engine. However, this was moving much too fast to be an aircraft and we did not hear any noise. The observers were a family group. Males and females, ages 18 to 45.

19970924	19971202	Huffman, TX	teardrop	5-10 sec.s	Summary : Large object seen running N. of FM 1960 bearing W.  It was about 1,000 through 4,000&apos; feet in altitude.  Looked to be between 5-8mi away.I was driving west on FM 1960 about 5 mi.s east of FM 2100.  I had been working on a car and was at this time test driving it.  The event occoured at 20:47.  I was driving and looking at the stars since it was a CLEAR night. (visibility only distorted by minor upper- atmosphere turbulence)  I then noticed the object.  It caught my eye because of it&apos;s intense brightness.  I stared at it allowing myself to accuire a good sight of the object.  It possessed the likeness of a comet.  It was shaped as a &quot;tear-drop&quot;.  It turned out a tremendous light.  Even brighter than the moon on it&apos;s most radiant nights.  It&apos;s light was pure white with no distortion apparent.  There is a tall radio antenna with warning strobe lights situated on it; however, this is not at all what I witnessed.  The object, though described as a comet had none of a comet&apos;s properties; i.e.  A tail, haze behind the comet, small size and the other distinguishing features of a comet.  The object not only very brigh! t but also seemed to be very low (between 1,000 to 3,000&apos;) and able to acchieve great speed.  The object was headed west on about a 280 degree heading.   Although I was driving between 75-80mph it seemed to pull away from me unlike anything I have ever seen.  I attempted to try and keep up with it but I lost sight of it  when The trees alongside the road blocked my vision of the object.   Make note I live near an airport and I used to live near an Air Force base.  I know how planes fly and I know the acceleration an airplane can obtain.  But as this object was 5-8mi.s out.  For an airplane to accelerate such as this thing did it and to dissapear from my field of view it would have to have an extrodinary engine, acceleration rate, and exaust hider (afterburner, it would be needed if this were even to be tried).  I have NEVER seen such a feat.  This event escapes my mind.  I have been made fun of and discredited even by almost everyone, including friends.  Anything you could tel! l me would be GREATLY appreciated!!!! I have tried to find out if something was going on that night, plane problem, U.S. Military trial of new plane but nobody has said anything.  If you have anymore questions I can be E-Mailed at((address deleted)) I would like to try and resolve this matter. I am a very observant person. When I observed the object I was trying to remimber details of it.  I studied it closely in the short time that it remained in my vision.

19951127	19970704	Lyons, CO	other	20 minutes	Summary : Hole (50 feet by 30 feet) opens up on hill side.  Light streams from it along with motor noise.  Closes again and leaves no sign of existence.The following event has been something I have kept quiet about for almost one and  a half years.  It was not until I read an account on this site about a UFO sighting east of my area on 11-27-95 that I realized it might be UFO related.The  phenomena occurred on the night of 11-27-95.  At that period my wife and I would often walk around the hills of our small mountain town during the evening.   It was near 8 PM when we were ascending up a small gulch to the NE of our town.  I happened to look up the east hill slope and saw a large black area.  At that moment a light came on  in the area: it was a large hole in the ground about 50 feet long and maybe 30 feet wide.  It was slightly above us and about 170 feet away.   There was for a short time the sound of a motor, like that of an air-compressor.  The sound was a steady &lsquo;puut puut puut puut&rsquo; like a one cylinder engine.  The light illuminated the sides of the hole (actually it was very bright) and we saw the fresh surface of broken rock around the hole&apos;s sides.  As we continued to ascend the gulch I told my wife that it was probably the site of a new house being built.  I figured that it was a hole for a basement.  The light was bluish-white like that seen in !the older mercury vapor lights.  The motor sound only lasted a minute and once the light went off only come on again.  I assumed that the owner was in the hole doing work.  Other than wondering how such a hole was dug into solid sandstone I gave no special thought to the event.  I almost decided to walk over and look in but decided not to since the owner might not want me on his land.  We ended up seeing the hole from several heights (both from below and slightly above) and several angles as we walked on towards home.  Several months passed.  On 3-10-96 it was a fine Spring morning and my wife and I decided to go up and see how the new house was coming along.  As we topped the rise above the small gulch all that met our eyes was a smooth hillside covered with old weeds and grass with a few small stones.  Nothing appeared to have been moved for decades!  As a child I had read about such things, but that type of phenomena was one kind that I had refused to believe possible.

19790601	19971207	Alameda, CA	disk	three minutes	This is a very delayed report: While stationed at the Alameda Naval air station in California. It was I believe early in 1979 when their was much publicity concerning the NASA &quot;Sky Lab&quot;. Much information was being given out via the media concerning the sky lab and it decaying orbit. It was being reported to the public by several radio and TV stations that sometime with a few days skylab would eventually fall to earth. I recall overhearing this on a late news segment. The broadcast also indicated that it would possible to observe the sky lab as it passed overhead. They news gave a general direction in which to look and a general time also. My now ex-wife and a friend went outside to attempt to watch for the ill fated sky lab. It was a very clear and calm night. There was no wind or other noises to speak of. We were watching the sky for about 20 seconds when from the northwest moved right overhead was a giagantic object. So large it covered the entire sky above us. The object was very dark possible either black (or it seemed to not reflect light). or opague. It had some very small dim white light placed in random order around its hull. It was completely silent. We heard no engine noise or any other noise for that matter. The object rotated approx 90% as it &quot;hovered&quot; slowly. it then moved off over the hoizon. As the object moved off we then observed the &quot;sky lab&quot; pass overhead. Which resembled a regular satalite as it passed					2	8.5	563827	0.0000122	flying_saucers	0.000656599	0.066628751		
19971114	19971117	Olympia, WA	formation	10-20 seconds	Summary : Cluster of lights moving from West to East (I think) very slowly.  Similar to shooting stars, but much slower.I was driving on a well-trafficked road in Olympia (Division St.)  I believe this road runs North-South (I would have been driving North), although I could be wrong .  I noticed a cluster of lights in the sky, all of varying size, and all larger than stars.  There were more than five and less than a dozen, but I&apos;m unsure of the exact count.  If I was in fact driving north, then the lights would have been moving from West to East.  I was not the only one on the road at the time, and I know other drivers witnessed the event as well, because many were slowing down and craning their necks.  I also noticed some pedestrians pointing toward the sky in the direction of the lights.  I watched the lights for 10 to 15 seconds before they arced toward the ground as if they were falling, and disappeared behind some trees.  All the lights appeared to be moving at the same speed and in the same direction.  I am unsure of their color, although my initial guess would be white.  Also, my firs! t thought was that the lights were not aircraft lights, as in lightbulbs or some other electrically-produced lights, but were instead produced by flames or heat (which is why I compared them to shooting stars rather than planes).

It did not change direction, justdissappeared.Friday, 7/4/97, approximately 9:15pm, St. Charles, MO. Thisis about 30 minutes from downtown St. Louis.My family and I (as well as probably 30,000 others) wereat the St. Charles riverfront to watch fireworks. It hadjust started to get dark and we knew the fireworks would bestarting any time. I was looking into the sky to the southof where I was sitting and I saw a light streak across thesky. It went in an east-west direction. It was pretty bright. Itwas blue, maybe blue-green. It made no noise at all. Ittraveled in a straight path for probably at least fiveseconds. Then it just disappeared. It did not change direction,it just disappeared. It didn&apos;t even fade out. It was obviouslynot a firework, but I didn&apos;t know what it was. I figured itmust have been a firework, or a plane on fire, or an asteroidor something. But it was really too bright for any of that. Itdidn&apos;t actually have a tail, it was more of a streak of light.Fireworks started 15 minutes later.I am a computer systems analyst. My girlfriend is a cash dept.supervisor. My father is an engineer for McDonnell Douglas. Myfriend is a cab driver. We all saw it and asked &apos;what the hell wasthat?&apos;.Today I heard reports that others had seen it in CollinsvilleIL.

As I was staring at the stars, something caught my eye.  I saw what looked like a far away star, but was moving around in fast motion.  Ive seen shooting stars, this wasn&apos;t one.  It would move around the stars like as if going through some sort of maze.  I told my friend about it and we stopped the car, and stayed starring at it.  When it got to the point where we couldnt see it we drove ahead to see if we could keep watching.  We were both amazed at the fact that we knew this was something out of the ordinary.  It had to be a UFO.The star looking object was of color white mixed with yellow. Two people observed this.  The object would manuever around the stars in a fast motion.  We saw this on our way home.

We were on vacation in Pheonix and decided to drive out with her. What I saw was not ships, but what I would describe as.... Electrical entities?? Various shapes and colours of very fast moving lights??? They seem to reply to {J} as she talked to them, moving off at speeds and distances that were unbeleivable. Now here we are miles from anywhere, no tricks, or drugs, or booze. Just a cold night on the messa, the reservation police came, saw it was {J}, looked up in the sky and drove away as quick as they could go. She asked one set of two lights to go find her friend *Bobbee* The lights took off, and came back with a very bright, larger light, that sparkled and turned purple, stuck around for a while, then when a jet came in the area, they all just took off. No sound, no clouds, I have no idea what I saw, but I saw it!??? If anything like this has ever been seen before, please write me back. If you want the directions, I&apos;ll gladly give them up. can&apos;t tell you what I saw, but I know I&apos;m going back to see this again someday.				0	4	7.7	403014	0.0000193	alien_abduction	0.001768868	0.037098609

19970503	19970506	Stafford, TX	other	10 seconds	Summary : Through telescope,observed amoeba or translucent object containing lights of blue red and white.Seemed distorted though could not see through itObserving Mars through C-8 telescope and 30mm eye piece when an object came into view.  I immediately thought it was odd and tracked it through the eye piece.  It must have been heading roughly due north since I only adjusted declination to track it. It appeared to be like an &quot;amoeba&quot; containing lights of red, blue and white.  It seemed there was distortion and the lights varied in position as if mildly bouncing yet constrained by individual points and still all part of the same object.  That described distortion was nothing like atmospheric and since I spotted the polar ice cap and terrain colors in a town near Houston, it seems odd.  I knew I was seeing something extraordinary and allowed my wife to look into the eye piece as I spun the declination knob at an appropriate speed.  Apparently I had only captured part of the object since she described the end section I had described plus a disc of lights numbering a dozen, half circle of red and half blue with two white lights!opposite each other outside of the circle.  Further, there were two fainter lights inside the circle and one outside towards the trailing section.  She reported sharper detail in some of the lights.  I moved back to view and had lost the object.  I scanned and found nothing.  We looked to the sky and saw nothing.  There was no noise.  We only got a few seconds each to look at it.  I&rsquo;m sorry I let my wife look since I may have been able to track it longer and get a better look.  I spent the rest of the evening tracking airplanes and could not get the same results.  I later heard of sightings like this with terms like &quot;jellyfish&quot; and &quot;translucent&quot; which prompted me to report that I think I&rsquo;ve seen the same thing.

19970819	19970820	London (UK/England),	circle	0.3	Summary : small circular flashing object emiting different colours, seemingly shaking, plus another circular object separating and parallel to, occasionally joining each other with beams of light.At approximately 11.00pm on Tuesday 19th August 1997 I witnessed a strange event for about half an hour. What can only be described as a circle of lights changing colour rapidly, from yellow to orange to blue to green to red to yellow and repeating.  The circle seemed to be shaking and moving in the air.  It then split into two identical objects as previously mentioned.  Then flying parallel to each other they became joined by beams of light as if they were one large object.  I continued to watch until I realised I had never seen an object such as this in the sky before.  It wasn&apos;t a plane or a satelite, I can say this with confidence as I live in a very tall building and frequently look at the sky at night through a pair of binoculars; and the cloud cover was too low to see any stars.					4	7.7	403014	0.0000193	alien_abduction	0.001768868	0.037098609

19700601	19970402	Columbus, OH	disk	1 OR 2 MIN.	Summary : I SEEN  A UFO WHEN I WAS ABOUT 13 YEARS OLD. THE YEAR WAS ABOUT1970,  IT WAS IN THE FALL IN COLUMBUS OHIO. AT FIRST I THOUGH I SAW A BLIMP WITH LIGHTED ADVERTISING (THE KIND THAT IS COMPUTERIZED) OFF IN THE SKY BUT IT WAS TOO FAR AWAY TO SEE CLEARLY. A UFO WAS THE LAST THING ON MY MIND. BUT AS I STARED AT IT TO SEE WHAT IT WAS  ITSTARTED COMING DOWN TOWARD ME  FROM THE SKY AND HOVERED JUST IN FRONT OF ME  ABOUT 50 FEET ABOVE THE GROUND. IT WAS DEFINITELY A SAUCER SHAPE AND IT  WAS SILENT, IT WAS GOLD AND THE CENTER OF IT  LOOKED LIKE REVOLVING MIRRORED PANELS THAT NOW I WOULD SAY WERE SOLAR COLLECTORS BUT BACK THEN I HAD NO IDEAL WHAT SOLAR POWER WAS. IT WAS IN THE AFTERNOON ON A CLEAR DAY WITH THE SUN SHINING ON THE CRAFT FROM BEHIND ME SO I DEFINITELY SEEN IT IN THE BEST LIGHT POSSIBLE. IT JUST HOVERED THERE FOR A SHORT TIME ANDTHEN JUST FLEW UP AND AWAY FROM ME TO THE RIGHT  VERY FAST AND OUT OF SITE. AT THE TIME I WAS HEADED FOR A WOODED AREA WITH A BB GUN IN MY HANDS. I DO NOT KNOW IF THE GUN HAD ANYTHING TO DO WITH ITS INTEREST IN ME BUT I THINK IT MAY HAVE BEEN  THE REASON. IF I HAD NOT SEEN THIS I THINK THAT I WOULD NOT BELIEVE ANY OF THE UFO STORIES THAT WE HEAR OF. I FIND IT VERY HARD TO BELIEVE THAT ANY BEINGS FROM OUTER SPACE COULD TRAVEL SUCH A VAST DISTANCE BUT MAYBE IT&apos;S JUST BEYOND MY COMPREHENSION. SOMETIMES I THINK IT MUST HAVE BEEN A SECRET MILITARY AIR CRAFT OR TEST CRAFT BUT I SAW IT OVER 25 YEARS AGO AND HAVE NOT SEEN ANYTHING AT ALL LIKE IT SINCE. BELIEVE ME OR NOT THERE IS NO DOUBT IN MY MIND ABOUT WHAT ISAW. I CAN&apos;T EXPLAIN WHERE IT CAME FROM BUT I CAN TELL YOU WITH CONVICTION THAT FLYING SAUCERS DO EXIST.

It caught my eye because of the straight line and how bright it was.  I was watching it and trying to figure out what it was, when it slowly started fading away, and then it was completely gone.  I looked around in the sky and noticed there were no other stars out.  At first I thought it might be an airplane, but it disappeared so fast.

Summary : Two people driving northbound on Rt. 95 near the New Hampshire/Maine border witness an &quot;almost crescent moon&quot;-shaped object hovering in the sky &amp; glowing bluish-white. The object fell towards the car and then vanished from sight.We were driving toward Maine at 10:21 p.m. on Tuesday, November 25, 1997 when a bright bluish-white object became visible directly ahead and to the left of our car. It was almost crescent-shaped(the curve was not sharply defined). It remained in sight for approximately five seconds and then fell toward the car, increasing in brightness, and then vanished from sight. We looked for several minutes for another trace of the object, but could not find any. The witnesses were two musicians, aged 20 &amp; 18, both of whom are also amatueur UFO investigators who reside in Hyannis on Cape Cod, Massachusetts.				0	4	7.7	403014	0.0000193	alien_abduction	0.001768868	0.037098609		
19970331	19970506	Jasper/Hinton Aiport (Canada), AB	sphere	15minutes	Summary : 4ships, one comet, and a bright light out of no whereAfter dinner at a local restaurant, my husband and I decided to take a look at the sky. We were hoping to see a clear night so we could later come back and photograph the comet.We drove out to the airport farthest from town. The road going in is dirt, and scary, but he grew up here, where I am from the east coast of the states. To me, it was extremely dark out, even with the clear sky.When we arrived at the final part of the road into the airport, we were facing an south easterly direction. In front of us in the sky, were some objects flying from east to west, as best I could tell.I asked my husband to stop, and we got out and watched them fly just under mars and disappear. Later I discovered he had seen two objects closer to the horizon, flying west to east, and flying in a closer formation than what I saw. They were orange in color, and round in shape, but also very far away.They were also flying to fast to be the usual satellite, and too high up to be a plane.I&apos;d seen a light like that last year while looking up at the comet of 1996, while at a pit stop, so I didn&apos;t think much of it.There is a light at the actual airport that didn&apos;t give us very good viewing of the comet, so we drove back onto the road where we could see. We looked around, and decided to go back home for the camera as picture taking would be excellent, and saw a car comingtowards us. He started up the car, and we took off to home, when out of my window, facing mars, I saw the light returning from the west...just one. I asked him to stop again, I see it I said. As soon as I said it, the object turned straight towards usand I started to scream to him, oh my God, it&apos;s coming at us! They&apos;re coming for us! I was so scared, and it seemed to fly from a high altitude to a lower one, at which point I began to get very afraid, and I started to yell at it to go away, that we didn&apos;t want it here, and it couldn&apos;t take us.By the time he had stopped and turned off the car, the object was already speeding away up into the sky, and as he jumped out of the car, I saw the last of it disappear.It happened so quickly, and I was so afraid that we went home to calm down a bit....he still wanted a picture of the comet, and I wasn&apos;t about to stay home alone, so I went with him, and we saw nothing, probably because we were prepared with a camera this time!Just this past weekend, a friend of ours said they saw something similiar flying over Hinton, around three am, when he was driving back from Edmonton.I also note that an earthquake, unusual for this area, happened the morning before our sighting, and was a 4.2 (?) located just southeast of Jasper. I reported this to a an association up here called AUFORA, but I haven&apos;t heard anything from them. We also checked the flight log at the airport when we went back, andthere was no flight recorded, although there was a plane landed from out of town, and a few unoccupied cars.My husband and I are 30 and 24 repectively, and lead fairly normal lives. Both of us have art degrees, and are planning our first business venture as I write this.				0	4	7.7	403014	0.0000193	alien_abduction	0.001768868	0.037098609

Then slowly moved off to the east out of sight from my window.  No sounds heard.Was asleep in townhouse second floor bedroom with blinds open.  Awoke facing  window; saw dark grey object in the air not moving (maybe 50&gt; feet up...difficult to tell).  Object or objects appeared hexagonal-shaped.  Could have been 5-6  objects clustered into one unit; or just one object.  May have had something hanging down from it (rope-like); but I was looking through open blinds that, of course, have cords that run vertically connecting them; so hard to tell.  Sat up to look more closely, and object slowly moved past upper left corner of window out of sight.  Today I heard about &quot;comets or space debris&quot; seen in sky here around 2115  last night.

19970803	19970819	Sand Springs (15-20mi. E/SE of), MT	other	5 minutes	Summary : The object flew almost like a butterfly, very high up (30-40K+), blinking blue and red in four distinct spots as it flew from side to side along it&apos;s E to W flight path.The object flew rather slowly, at a fairly high altitude (it appeared higher than the passenger jets I had seen earlier that night).  It veered, in a wavering motion as if seeing it through heat, from side to side along its flight path, growing brighter then going dim or off at the apex of its pendular movement, then reappearing to the other side of its flight path as it grew bright again.  The movement along the path was reminiscent of a butterfly&apos;s erratic path, but this wasn&apos;t erratic. The four light panels/spots were also similar to a butterfly&apos;s in that the forward two were slightly larger or brighter than the rear two.  The object came from the east, continued west, and eventually veered to the N/NW.  This occured on a completely cloudless night at approximately 2335.  The sighting only lasted as long as it took the object to pass.  The speed required to continually make the turns it was making was what really caught my eye as not being any typical craft. No flying object in my experience flies or lights up like that one did. over; perhaps 5 minutes at most.  My best guess as to its velocity would place it between 200-300kts.  I am a military intelligence specialist and have worked in the aerial reconnaissance field for nearly 3 years.				0	4	7.7	403014	0.0000193	alien_abduction	0.001768868	0.037098609

I noticed an unusually bright red object in the E/SE and stopped to look. Thought it was Mars but too bright. Too high for radio tower. Blimp? Did not move for over 15 minutes. still there when i had to leave. Haven&apos;t seen since. Family watched. We are military brats so know aircraft. This was weird. My girls got scared because i kept saying that whatever it was it wasn&apos;t normal. I expected to see an article in the paper about it. A nova star? Perhaps it was the planets aligning that night? It had teh steadiness of a star or planet but it was very bright. At one point there seemed to be three interior lights, a little less bright. I thought it was my eyes but my wife and two kids saw it too. I went to California a week later and told a friend who said a similar light was reported in Santa Barbara on NOv 15 but it was reportedly a rocket launch. Maybe so, but what I saw was not a rocket launch.	Capitol National Bank Building Heliport	0.068984209	2872559	2.167363704	4	7.7	403014	0.0000193	alien_abduction	0.001768868	0.037098609

19860411	19971120	Aswan (Egypt),	disk	1 hour	Summary : Sky show of approximately 30 ufos &apos;cavorting&apos; for 1 hour over Nile river at Aswan,Egypt.Myself &amp; 2 others witnessed a l hour &apos;sky show&apos; of round bright objects overhead.We were on the top deck of a boat on the Nile River at Aswan, Egypt. We were with a tour to see the event of Haley&apos;s comet leaving earth that day. It was too hazy to see the comet,so we watched the clear sky overhead. Lights started to appear &amp; move at great speed in all directions &amp; angles. We counted at least 30 or more. It was like play, as there was no pattern to moves. They cavorted all around each other. This lasted 1 hour. Just before dawn,about 5 am, one craft broke away &amp; swooped down towards us at great speed.  It did a pass over our heads &amp; disappeared into the dawn sky very fast. It showed us a definate round flat disc as it came close. It appeared like a celebration at the exact time of the comet&apos;s last view from earth. It was awesome. The observers were the Tour leader, myself a registered nurse &amp; another registered nurse. I have observed other ufo displays similar to this, but have never seen the disc so clearly or low. In the dim dawn light, it appeared kind of brownish colored. It moved too fast to see any other details.					4	8.4	488537	0.00000963	flying_saucers	0.006545455	0.030076997		
19850630	19971107	San Diego, CA	light	4 seconds	Summary : Man driving car with nephew enveloped in white light of high quality. Man observed no shadows even under dashboard. Man could not look above nephew&apos;s knees or  see outside vehicle though tried. Man  not scared about possible accident. Nephew remembers nothing even though he said &quot;What was that.&quot; immediately after event.Man was 36 years old and enjoys daydreaming. State employee. Prior to the event I had said to myself that I travel this section of road when going to work but this was a different time of day. Felt very alert during event , as if taking a college final exam.The event lasted more than 4 seconds because I did so much thinking while it was happening. Estimate 14 seconds based on all my thoughts. I remember thinking during the event that this light was from a star that had been engineered by intelligent  life to improve the quality of light above the quality of sunlight. Just thinking this takes 3 or 4 seconds. My nephew was 15 years old and never had any dreams he could remember. His first dream he ever remembered was when he was about 23. I slept well that night. I am baffled by the event. It isn&apos;t logical. When I drive I sometimes look off the road for 2 or 3 seconds. 4 seconds would be a little dangerous and that is why I feel the event took 4 seconds. The light came on and ! went off instantly. My nephew&apos;s feet were positioned such that his toes were slightly pointing towards the toes of the opposite foot. His heels were touching his seat. This knowledge takes time. Also,  I spent at least 7 seconds trying real hard to see any shadow. I was aware that I could not see through the windshield but wasn&apos;t scared.

19950519	19970419	Glendale, CA	triangle	1:30	Summary : Girlfriend and I saw three red lights forming a triangle shape moving north. My first thought, Helicopter, but no sound was heard, from anything, when I think about it.approx (3) white smaller lights traveling with it. I&apos;m starting to wonder if we were looking at something that , maybe..droped us off?I know how that sounds. This is gut feeling purely.First, this is all in retrospect, accuacy would require meeting with ex-girlfriend due to my lack of memory regarding anything prior to that sight.Sholl Canyon Park, top of Glenoaks Blvd, in Glendale, CA. A park is there where we would go to spend time  together, ie, the view..a couple thing. I recall being in the middle of the street with her, walking uphill, it seems we both recognized it at the same time.  Three points of lights (all red) forming a triangle shape.  We were walking up hill maybe eastbound  facing the mountains, Mt Wilson to be more accurate.  What got our attention was my saying, &quot;shsss, I can&apos;t hear anything&quot;  Approx; (3) other white lights were in it&apos;s immediate vacinity. I say approx, because the Burbank Glendale skies are always lit up considering the Burbanks airport. My closest comparison would be this description. I though maybe it was three different helicopters flying in a triangle formation.  Being that the lights were lower that the top of Mt wilson, that tells me it was very close ( a few miles if that) Only no blinking lights that usually gives us a human identification. I don&apos;t know if yo!u could see through the center   because it was the same color as the backround mountains, which is black. Anyway we both stood like dazed children, lost in the middle of the street. And watched it move slowly north untill it looked like it vanish behind Burbanks city lights. not once did we here anything we could associate with what we know is in our skies.  And for some reason I dismissed it and labled it three helicopters., because if it wasn&apos;t three different light sources generating that triangular or greater than sign &quot; &lt; &quot;  tilt that about 90 degrees, so that the bottom light is where the rear propeller would be a single craft. If it wasn&apos;t 3 choppers, then it was truly massive in my eyes. No sound what so ever, no wind no traffic, no nothing but us talking and saying &quot;look at that!&quot; &quot;what is that&quot;? &quot;shhh, let me listen&quot; In retrospect, I wonder, is it a valid possibility, ...ok, hear it go..that we were looking at something that dropped us off?..I&apos;m not mental or at lea!st no ones labled me that, yet. I say this because, we simply did not have the excitement that I feel now. It&apos;s like remembering a faint dream, or just residue of a dream. I need to speak to my ex-girlfriend, (Sandie) I know she remembers it. She said &quot;it my first  sighting&quot;					1	5.8	61018	0.000017	alien_abduction	0.012320329	0.010652726

While the others were still inside I looked up at the stars for no particular reason. In the northwest sky, just above the big dipper I noticed about 6 orange amber dots in a V formation moving north above the big dipper. I told the others &quot;hey come check this out&quot;. One dot in the V seemed to be moving in towards one leg then back out, yet keeping pace with the formation. We moved to the backyard to get a better look. As this formation started to fade it seemed to rotate into a circle formation just before disappearing. The formation definitely seemed as though it was very far away (not in our atmosphere), and possibly leaving our planet. I have seen shooting stars and satellites many times before. This was not one of them.	Puget Sound Plaza Heliport	0.209791157	505783	2.340909814	4	7.7	403014	0.0000193	alien_abduction	0.001768868	0.037098609

I looked to the east and saw a very strange looking craft flying (?) very slowly in the sky. It was moving away I assume as it was getting smaller. It was very visible against the Superstition Mountains. It moved slowly from north to south and back again in what appeared to be a ric-rac pattern. It was quite large, I agree with the others who put their arm up and measured with a closed fist. It appeared triangular in shape, I related it to a &quot;squashed&quot; pyramid. I saw three very bright white lights, one in each corner and one at the top of the  &quot;pyramid&quot;.  In the center was a very, very bright pulsating red light, bigger in circumference than the three white lights. I would describe the white lights as three powerful strobe lights. We watched the object for several minutes and we amazed that something that large could move so gracefully! and so silently. We could hear no sound at all. It gradually faded into the south east sky.

Othersthought they were UFOs. The other half of the group immediately began looking in the sky for the objects. Within 30 secondstwo of the craft return moving east to west at 15 feet above the groundand dance, move in and out away from each other, separate with sharp turns, one left, one right, and then in perfect formation, depart into the northwestsky at tremdous speed disappearing.. The caft also had two red identifying lights undeneath the wings. They were luminous, as if litonly by the moonlight.  They were completely quiet and fast.  The writter has seen Large orange balls of light which were believed to be UFOs in the past, but these ships/craft were dimensional-see-thru to a degree.  ONe witness who was standing awayfrom the group with the writter, thought she was seeing someone flying a kite-the kind used incompetetion-two handed.  She remarked to the writter that the kite had little red lightson it so the owner could see it.  She hadn&apos;t heard any word from the group and the writter turned his head just in time to see the craft to the left, turn to the side and then disappear.The writter mentioned to her that there wasn&apos;t any wind.   This was around 8:45pm in a small city park without lights nearby to disturb the evening events of the eclispe and comet.  The writter talkedto most of the group who described the event as it has been written here.  The witnesses were business owners, professional Spiritual Teachers, Artist, Musicians, and everyday people.There was no alchol or drugs at this event, and was a Ceremonial Gathering.

He saw that &quot;blue/green ball&quot; on the 4th of July.  He explained pretty much what the radio reports had said.  He said most of his family saw it.  He explained what he saw without even hearing the radio report.  After he told me what he saw, I told him that he matched the reports.  He is POSITIVE that it wasn&apos;t an airplane or a firework.  Other than that, he has no idea.  It isn&apos;t really that big of a deal to him.  He could care less.  I just find this facinating. Here is an additional note:  One of the crew of radio station KMOX in St. Louis also saw the light in the sky.  He saw it while station out on the KMOX building balcony as he waited for the Fair St. Louis fireworks to begin.  Try and contact him for more info.  They have a website.  Just search for KMOX.

At first it was a small orange body giving me the impresion that I was looking at another meteor but the object just got larger and brighter, after seeing the object grow in size and brightness it continued to travel across the sky with a slight wobble in it path (like viewing a object through hot air). This wobble lasted for about 30 seconds then it continued to travel in a stright line. Its speed also slowed down as it crossed the sky. As it passed overhead the bright orange glow started to disapate. This allowed me to make out a flashing light on the upper surface of the craft the light flashed about every second. The craft passed overhead at about 10,000 feet. As the craft disapiered into the trees behind the campsite I heared the slight roaring sound of jet engines. Flight path was from the south east to the north west. No sonic booms. are we test aircraft that can fly after entering atmospher?				0	4	7.7	403014	0.0000193	alien_abduction	0.001768868	0.037098609		
19960405	19970317	San Diego, CA	formation	60 seconds	Summary : Two military members sighted two red lights north of downntown San Diego.The two of us were in a position on Fifth Ave in downtown San Diego&apos;s Gaslamp Quarter about two blocks from the convention center.  We were on the first floor of a building on the south side of the street.&gt;From our angle near the window, we could see over the top of the buildings to the north of our position.  People on the street were screened by the opposite buildings, and people farther inside the room where we were could not seeout over the buildings due to the low overhang of the window.Both of us, at the time, were in the Navy base stationed in San Diego.  Both of us held jobs in navigation. We were usedto using our eyes to identify far off lights. I have heard over the previous four yearsmany stories from veteran sailors, of many instances in the last few decades that ships have actually followed {or been followed)by UFO&apos;s on the open sea.  Before this happened, though, I was unsure of the truth to many of the stories.  Whilelooking to the north over the buildings across the street, I noticed two, bright red lights up in the sky.  What caughtattention is that one of them moved back and forth across the sky in an extreme fashion, though the arc of movement wassmall, maybe two or three degrees.  The speed with which the object moved was incredible.  At this time I pointed it out tomy friend  He also looked up and was immediately transfixed.  I am unsure of the exact length of time that we watched the objects, because the event was eleven months ago, but it was probably about sixty seconds.  During that time the two lights would hover for a few moments and then move in formation.  At the end, they both accelerated away at a very high speed. Aftertalking about it for a few days, we soon dexcAfter we witnessed this, we looked around to see if anyone else had been watching.  As mentioned before, we were the only onesthat had a vantage point.  We tried to think of any possible explanation for the sighting. We quickly eliminated jets orhelicopters, celestial bodies, or reflected light.  We had no idea what the lights were.  At the time, I did not really know anybodythat we could tell.  I recently bought a computer.  I soon found this site.  I decided to let you know about the event, albeit late.

19970317	19970321	Aquaduct (near, over desert, before entering California), CA	triangle	1-2 min.	Summary : Flying Westward in a UAL plane over the desert near the aquaduct before entering CA, another UAL plane approached and passed beneath us. I noticed its approach and then realized that it had a unusual, triangular-shaped aircraft flying close and to the left of its tail.  This craft? was about 1/4 the size of the UAL plane, triangular-shaped, flat, light grey color. Why?On Feb. 17, I was returned from Chicago on a United Airlines flight to Ontario, CA at about 10AM in the morning. We were flying at about 32,000 feet and the weather conditions were very clear.  Approaching us from the south going north and a bit easterly, I noticed another aircraft flying beneath us.  I am no expert, but I could identify the aircraft as a UAL aircraft. What originally got my attention was that it didn&apos;t seem too far beneath our flight and it seemed so clear because of the lack of clouds, dust, etc.  Then, I noticed that something (another craft?) was tagging along with it, rather close and off the left side of the UAL&apos;s tail.  When I looked closer, I couldn&apos;t figure out what it was or why it was following so closely.  I am not sure of the model of the UAL aircraft, but the &quot;unknown&quot; flying with it was about a quarter of the UAL&apos;s size, triangular shaped, point forward (but the forward point was slightly rounded toward the tip).  Its color was a flat, light g!rey - not shiny as a usual, unpainted aircraft would be.  It was as though the two crafts were flying in formation - that close.I keep them plain in sight until they had passed completely beneath our flight.There is probably a logical explanation for this, but it seemed very strange to me and when I review the sight in my mind, it still seems strange.   Others on the plane may have noted it, but no one else mentioned it.  I was sitting in a row next to a window, just forward of the leading edge of the aircraft, by myself.  My husband picked me up at the airport in Ontario and I mentioned it to him right away.  He guessed maybe it was some kind of target or balloon, but it did have some depth to it, yet nothing on top that I could see which might be like a raised cockpit area, nor did it have any tail(s) or projections, nor any indentation on the back edge like I have seen on some experimental aircraft.  Strange color, too, not too noticeable in the distance and if it had not been so clear, it might have disappeared into the desert sands and dust.  If there is an obvious answer to this one, I would appreciate some feed back.  Thanks				0	4	7.7	403014	0.0000193	alien_abduction	0.001768868	0.037098609

It changed colors from a brilliant white to a pale bluish hue.We were driving along Highway 11 at about 2 am at a rate of 55 miles per hour.  In the northeast quadrant we saw a bright white object tht caught our eye because it was moving very quickly.  it moved  from the east to the west and stopped on a dime it looked to be enormous and might have been seen from quite a distance .  We pulled the car over and got out to view it better. The object while it was stopped changed from the bright white light  we originally saw changed to a bluish hue.  It looked as though it was hovering over or near EROS Data Center. The cows in the field on the east side of the road seemed to be come nervous and start walking around. The object then darted off at a 90 degree angle and went straight up until it vanished.

19610801	19970330	Subic Bay (Philippines),	circle	30 min.	Summary : Looking east about 10 to 15 degrees above the horizon, I saw this starlike object at a very high speed. There was only one light which is the bottom of the craft. The object was round as I can can see it from below. It was at night so I cannot tell what the upper portion of the object look like.The object was coming at a very high speed and stopped over us.I was amazed by this object, traveling at high speed and made a suuden stop and hover with no overrun. As it hover us, the object turn on its bright light and I could see clearly for about a mile. It was like daylight with no heat.I would also like to add that I did not hear an engine sound from this object and thats what scared me. I thought to myself that this object is not from earth. Also, I have kept this a secret for 35 years, because I don&apos;t know what it was until last summer I saw on the television a special onUFO sightings. It was an astronaut orbiting around the earth who saw it first coming towards earth and I was the second one to see it here on earth. I don&apos;t Know if there are more people saw this on earth.((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD))					0	1.1	0	0.0000114	flying_saucers	0.259259259	0.000590603

19970527	19970529	Laguna Park, TX	cigar	5 minutes	Summary : At about 24:35 my friends and I were traveling to Laguna Park on Highway 56, when we saw an odd looking aircraft hovering above at about 1000 feet. when we stopped to look at it, it started off slowly at first, then at a much faster rate. It then disapeared.Well my friends, Topher, Sean and I (Jusin),were traveling back from Waco on highway 56 at about 12:30 when we saw a strange object hovering about 1000 feet in the air obove a field by the highway. It was (frome the positioning of the lights) a triangle shaped object. At first we thought it was a plane but then we realized it was hovering. It had about 5 white lights, and 3 red lights, and one light that seemed to revolve around the craft. we could not tell the size but I don&apos;t think it was too big. About the size of a normal air craft. We pulled over to get a better look at it. It stayed put for about three full minutes untill we got out of the car. When we got out of the car, it started to move, slowly at first, then quite rapidly, untill lightning brightened up the sky and it disapeared. I was starting to get stormy. We looked for it for another two or three minutes but couldn&apos;t see it. We sat there for a few minutes in awe and asked ourselves if we really saw anything at all, we each said yes.

19631123	19971121	USS Kearsarge (at sea, out of Japan),	chevron	5 minutes	Summary : Observed 5 lights in a inverted &quot;V&quot; rise from the horizon, hover for a few minutes and then sink back down below the horizon. We were at sea on our way back to the U.S. from Japan. Lights were simular to the Phoenix &quot;V&quot; lights.Me and my friend M. B. were walking accross the flight deck, I don&apos;t remember why anymore. It was at dusk but not dark yet. We first saw a bright light on the horizon directly behind the ship. It rose up and then there were 3 which continued to rise to 5 lights. They stayed there for awhile not moving or anything. I told my friend I should go get my camera but he said the lights would be gone by then. Shortly after that the lights descended to below the horizon. We went the the CIC room and asked the radar operator if there was anything behind us, he said no. We never said why we were asking or said anything about what we had saw. I can&apos;t remember that we ever talked about it after that because M. said no one would believe us anyway and I agreed. Until I heard about  the Phoenix lights on 3-13-97 I haven&apos;t mentioned this to a whole lot of people. As to when this happened I am thinking it was 3 days out of Japan and the ship was traveling about 30 knots. It was a warm night as I remember. I don&apos;t remember that the lights flickered but do remember that they were white.				0	0	1.1	0	0.0000112	flying_saucers	0.205882353	0.000743722		
19970422	19970422	Worcester, MA	egg	30seconds	Summary : It was a bright white/Yellow light, moving at an incredible speed.  Too fast for any plane Went from west to East, The White light would dissapear and then reappear, but it was not moving behind a cloud.  The back had 4 very close together lights.  About 5,000 ft. high.  It was egg shaped, and none of the lights were blinking.  No E.B.E.  encounter was experienced.The craft was egg shaped.  Had a bright light on the side of the craft that was white/yellow.  The light would fade out and dissapear , and then reapper, we know it was not a clould in the path of vision because none were present at the time.  From the rear of the craft there were 4 lights closely together, they were tiny compared to the one on the side, and they wren&apos;t as bright.  The light on the side when it went out would reappear half way across the sky  so it was moving at a very incredible speed much faster than a plane.

19801201	19970710	Franklin (5 miles south of), TN	rectangle	3 minutes	Summary : Close encounter/Franklin Tn.Coming down Old Hillsboro Rd., in the winter of 1980, I saw a very brilliant light. It was low to the ground, sort of shadowing the top of the trees. In other words the craft was following the contour of the landscape. As it got closer the light divided into two lights of which they appeared to be some type of flood light. It also looked like shafts of light the farther away it got. It proceeded to come in and the closer it came to the road the lower it got. I was so amazed with the sight that I stopped the car and got out, my wife was in the car with me. I had completely cut the motor of the vehicle off. This craft was flying soundlessly over the road and us.  It was shaped like a rectangular box, with a slanted plexiglass looking windshield. It was moving very slowly, and my wife was telling me to get into the car and lets go. It was a full moon night and we both saw the ufo very plainly. Not like some kind of light in the sky, we saw the entire vehicle. And I have not been the same until this very day. My wife and I are not mental patients and have never been. We don&apos;t drink or do any type of drugs. We attend church regularly and are the parents of four children.				0	2	6.8	76331	0	None	0.039473684	0.003324875

Too late for the comet so we got a pair of binoculars and WOW.  5 BRIGHT orange lights in a V formation.  Not moving at first and then they were moving very slowly.  We went to get a better view and they were gone!  Where we live they would have been flying over the Lake Mead area .  Possibly Red Lake.   My husband and I are in our 40&apos;s.

19970403	19970412	Melbourne (VIC, Australia),	egg	10 seconds ?	Summary : At aprox. 20.45 I noticed 2 light emitting pinkish egg shaped objects n/w of my position. They were aprox 50 miles away travelling extremely fast thru a 90 degree arc in aprox 10 sec. One turned sharply right then sharply left back to its  original course. The other followed seemingly to the millimetre. Finally at about s/w they turned right &amp; disapeared into the distance. I rang the Victorian UFO Society who had received reports of UFO&apos;s in the areas we viewed 40 to 50 miles away. My son also witnessed them. Too fast &amp; cornered too sharp to be anything we Know.Just prior to closing shop I had been informing the boys about comet Hale Bopp which should be visible at the end of the month; this conversation natuarally induced me to look at the sky once exiting the factory. The first thing which I believe caught the corner of my eye from the N/W was the speed of the two objects then the colour. I stared at them trying to define what they were. My curiosity turned to astonishment when one object turned hard right. ( I then yelled to my son &quot; check out the pink lights&quot; which he sighted directly without assistance) the object then banked hard left to its original course. To further my astonishment was the second object which followed the first through its flight path seemingly to the millimeter as if they were playing follow the leader. The objects continued on their course until they were aprox s/w where they turned right and rapidly disapeared into the distance.1/ Due to comprehending(as best my mind can) distance to the nearest star 4.2 LY which may support planets  I have never really believed in UFO&apos;s. Now not so sure.2/I am an amatuer astronomer &amp; therefore familiar with the night sky; I know the differance between stars,planets,satelites,lights &amp; reflections,planes, balloons, distance etc. These objects were definately none of the above.3/I would estimate these objects to be aprox 50 miles away.4/Today I received notification of one sighting in Werribee &amp; 2 sightings in Melton verifying our sighting and placing the objects at the same time and flight path.5/They travelled thru an arc of about 90 degrees in about 10 secs aprox 50 miles away.Too fast for anything known to me.6/They were at aprox 40 deg altitude.7/ They cornered to sharply for anything known to me. Very direct 45deg right/45 deg left- no arc.8/Referring to a map with the information available it is possibble they did a Zig-Zag turn to avoid flying directly over Melton or another small town in that proximity.9/It was possible to see they were solid egg shaped objects emitting a pinkish glow.10/They were to far away for sound if they making any.11/Both I (age 40) &amp; my son (age 20) believe what we saw to be controlled flight, flying solid objects without obvious propulsion  outside the limitations of anything we know.					4	7.7	403014	0.0000193	alien_abduction	0.001768868	0.037098609

19970324	19970323	Manassas, VA	formation	20-25 secs.	Summary : Seen 4 lights, high speed, very high altitude in the Manassas, VA area.I was outside walking my dog and observing the lunar eclipse around 11:20pm, I had been outside for about 20 minutes.  I was getting cold and it seemed like the eclipse wasn&apos;t really getting &quot;full&quot;, I was getting ready to head in and I noticed a very faint light, like a blur, kind of like when a search light goes across the sky.I looked back up and I seen 4 very soft or faint lights directly overhead and very high up.  I looked up with my binoculars to get a better look and I could see 4 lights, shaped like a triangle with 1 of the lights sort of trailing off the back right one, closer to it than the rest were to each other.  I watched them through thebinoculars for about 10 -15 seconds before they were out of sight.  The whole thing happened in about 20 - 25 seconds.  The lights were very faint sort of a hazy yellow color.  The sky at the time was crystal clear, about 10 minutes before the &quot;sighting&quot; the last of some clouds had passed by.  In comparison to any airplanes flying aroundtonight these lights were probably 3 or 4 times as high and 10 times faster.  I didn&apos;t hear any engines.  The whole thing is a bit of exciting also a bit of alarming, its the first time I&apos;ve ever seen something in the sky and couldn&apos;t figure out what it was.  It might have been military stuff but I don&apos;t think so, it was really very fast.I would just like to know what it was, I figure with all the people observing the eclipse tonight someone else should have seen it too.  If this service hears of someone else seeing it please e-mail me and let me know. Thanks.

We walked to the back clutching each other in an arm lock and standing in awe we observed it hanging motionless in the sky.It seemed to be putting on a show just for us because it split in two parts and then three forming a large triangle in the sky overhead.Each time it split it became as brilliant as the first object.There was no noise detected . All the objects started to rotate in the sky keeping the triange shape. We kept asking each other &quot;Did you see that?&quot; Finally the objects moved slowly off to the south and disappeared. We had a house full of peo! ple inside and we were so much in shock that we didnt go to the window and tell them to come out and see. My sister had a better encounter but that is her story.

19960615	19970718	Linesville, PA	light	1 hr	Summary : witnessed flashes of light like explosions along the West,East, and SouthWestern horizonsI, Steven, was camping out on top of a hill near a green water tank/well ,just outside of Linesville,Pa in Pine Township, myself , Mark, Micheal, Keith, Ryan, Regis, and thier sister Monique, were playing it tag, well it started to get late so Monique went to lay down , and myself and the others basically just hung around talking .Suddenly we noticed a flash of light coming from the sky behind us in the east , our backs were facing towards Linesville , when we turned around it appeared to be heat lighting so we shrugged it off . Well about a half hour went by and I saw a sight that reminded me of a A-Bomb explosion in space, just above the SouthWestern horizon. &quot;Look at that did you see that?&quot; I said to my friends , some of them said yes , the others said that they caught a glimpse of something .Well thinking that was it for the strangeness that the night would bring we started playing tag again , well me and Mark were on the western side of the green tank when Regis yelled for us to look * well we looked towards his voice , he was on the eastern side of the tank along with everyone else except me and Mark , we looked up and the heat lightning like light had returned in the eastern sky ,we ran as fast as we could to the others as the light continued to flash , as the light flashed in the eastern sky, we looked to the west and saw another explosive time of light like a A-Bomb, as the night continued the events diminished and we went to sleep scared  about what was going on but before went went to sleep all we could talk about was the events that had occured . I realize that there&apos;s not much to work with as far a solid proof but i think its important enough event to report to you anyway even after a year , thank you.

19970721	19970721	Nun&apos;s Island (Canada), PQ	formation	8 seconds	Summary : Formation of silent, pale round objects on top of cloud ceiling ( about 15% cloud cover).I can&apos;t believe what I saw! I am still bewildered. I was at a friend&apos;s place discussing a future project. About 10:20 PM I left the building to go back home. I got out of the side door and walked across the parking lot. The sky tonight is fairly clear, except a few clouds here and there. Suddenly on top of the clouds I saw what I first thought a cloud moving faily quick towards the North. As it passed the small group of clouds it was actually a group of five circles in some V formation, with 4 of the cricles on the right side, and one on the left. They were, and I noticed, evenly spaced. The color was some sort of light gray, paler than the clouds. I look down then up and it was still there, moving at a nonchalant speed direction North. Wow! Whatever it was it faded in the sky as it moved away (not because it disappeared, but because of the distance). I ran back to  my friend Mike&apos;s place and tried to reach him but the intercom was dead (usual). I ran under is porch and yell! ed his name. He and his girlfriend ran down to see what was happening. After telling them and looking for a while (it had been gone for a few minutes by then) I ran upstairs and drew what I saw on an envelop ( 4 frames ). Don&apos;t take me wrong, I am not a hardcore disbeliever, but I tend to believe that everything can be explained (especially UFO cases) but this one is a little tougher. It was not a reflection on the clouds, it was on top of them (they were really sparse too). It was not an airplane, it was too high. I called places to find out what the ceiling was but I could not find a place that would report that. I got on the web trying to find something and I got here by curiosity. It was not balloons, it travelled to fast (when I say it, I mean the formation). The formation was going at the same speed throughout the experience. I don&apos;t know what it was! I need to find out what the cloud ceiling was tonight a top Montreal so I can make approximations as to the size of the circles. Also was there a radar somewhere that could have recorded this? I&apos;m sending this then going back outside.				0	4	7.7	403014	0.0000193	alien_abduction	0.001768868	0.037098609

Small teardrop shape.While watching 4th of July fireworks display (from Belleville Area College), the royal blue light was observed directly overhead on an east to west heading (parallel to IL Route 161).  Sighting was about 3.5 mile SW of Scott AFB IL.  Object was moving very fast and had no real shpe that could be noted, if anything teardrop with a white sparkling contrail.  The object was NOT in the area or vacinity of any fireworks being displayed and was potentially observed by thousands of individuals watching the fireworks.  I offer the number of observers as 2+ as a neighbor and I were talking as we both saw the other than fireworks light.				0	4	7.7	403014	0.0000193	alien_abduction	0.001768868	0.037098609

0	19971005	Rohnert Park, CA	rectangle	1 minute	Summary : Saw black monolith type objectI was outside in my driveway smoking a cigarette, I looked up at the  stars and there was this very large black rectangle silently moving above me. There  were no lights and it made absolutely no noise. It  seemed to be very low, 20 to 40 feet above. I watched it go south until it was not in my sight. I am the kind of person who would be the first to call others over to look at some interesting thing, but I never did. In fact, I forgot about it until recently, which is weird because normally something that unusual I would recall.	Santa Rosa Memorial Hospital Heliport	3.889385854	0	0	0	1.1	0	0	None	0	0		
19970508	19970508	Citrus Heights (a suburb of Sacramento), CA	other	2 min (approx)	Summary : Object of an unknown type cruising at a low rate of speed over the area of Citrus HeightsWhile on my newspaper delivery route, I observed an object which I initially believed to be an aircraft decending to land. It then occured to me that it was in the wrong area to be either leaving or arriving at the airport. I then noticed that the lights which I had though were the wing tip lights, (which as you know blink red and green) were only white and that they were blinking in a circular pattern. There appeared to be a red light on the underside of the object which did not blink. The white lights were very bright and continued flashing the entire time that the object was visible to me. The object appeared to be cruising very slowly approximately 1 to 2 miles away. I could not hear any sounds coming from the object even though it is very quiet at that time of morning.The object appeared to be circular in shape but overall was similar to the shape of a derby hat with a domed section on top. from my vantage point I would estimate the size to be approximately 25 feet in diameter. As ti travelled I eventually lost sight of it as trees in the area blocked my view. I am a 45 year old male, I wear glasses and the other observer was my son who is a 15 year old male, he does not wear glasses. The entire sighting lasted approximately 2 minutes.				0	4	7.7	403014	0.0000193	alien_abduction	0.001768868	0.037098609		
19950327	19971201	Loveland/Estes Park (between), CO	light	45 min	Summary : It looked like a star that was moving across the night sky.  But it stopped and changed direction again and again.  It changed color and became up to 5 separate lights always moving closer to us.  Near the end we could see spotlights from the craft(s).  It disapeared straight up so fast it could not have been man made.We were all camping, and sober.  It was green at first and when it was clear it was not a star or satalite it changed into up to 5 lights.  They were all changing colors sometimes when forming shapes.  Squares with the bottm red and top green.  Then a diamond all blue then white.  We watched for 25 min. then our vision was blocked by a rock face.  We all discussed what we saw and decided if we climbed on top of this rock and we were able to see it again it was certainly not our imaginations.  we viewed it again from on top of this rock face for 20 min more.  We could now see spot lights coming from it- them...  It continued to change the shapes it was forming and color of the lights that were visable. The spotlights were changing color too.  It went back to a single light, brighter than it was befoe.  Then it changed in to 3 then 5 then 9 lights forming a hoop of white lights only.  No other colors just white.  It accelerated to the west and upward so fast that the hoop i! mprint of light was visable for atleast a full second after it was gone.  If it was man made I would like to meet the men who built it-them.  We were all pretty quiet for the last min or so just watching, but when it flashed away that fast all of us screamed at the same time in aknowledgemnet.  Witnesses I am sure ((Name deleted)) of Ft. Collins will not mind me giving his name and #  (970) # deleted)).  My name is ((Name &amp; # deleted)).  The other 2 witnesses stopped telling people what we saw, to stop the constant ridicule and attention.  ((Name deleted))  of Fort Collins and ((Deleted)) of Loveland.

19960531	19970509	Chinquipin (Matagorda county, 10 miles southeast of se, TX	light	5 minutes	Summary : A single point of light resembling a satallitebut moving very fast and making instant sharp turnsunlike any known object can.Me and my brother were sitting on the dock at our bay house fishing. My brothers attention was drawn away bywhat he believed to be a shooting star.He pointed at it but i was unable to locate it due to partial cloud cover, and its dimmness. He lost sight of it in the clouds, but regained sightof it comming out from the other side of the cloud. At that point he noted that the object made a course change of about 20 degrees and continuedout of sight over the horizon. The object followed an almost perfect north to south course untill the change which was slightly more to the east.I was unable to see this object as it was moving so fast it was gone in less than 10 seconds. There was no &apos;tail&apos; on the object, nor was theremore than one single point of light. its dimmness was equivilent to that of a satellite reflecting the sun in the evening and reflecting the suns light.After he settled down, and finished explaining his idea about it being a UFO, we went back to fishing, both of us now watching the sky.  Less than5 minutes later, the object reappeared, again from the north. this time I was the one who spotted it first and pointed it out to my brother. He confirmedthat it was the same object he viewed previously. With both of us watching, the object started a series of right angle turns that seemed to defy the laws of physics.It made about 6 or 7 course changes overhead and continued towards the south like origionally, and disappeared behind our bay house. It AGAIN reappeared out fromthe side of the bay house low on the horizon to the south over the gulf of mexico. at this point it was moving horizonally and was moving extremely fast the entire way.By extremely fast I mean like a shooting star moves fast. We both watched it move horizontally about 30-40 degrees across the horizon, then it turned again, in a very sharpzero curve turn to a northerly direction. It proceeded across the sky making one final course change of about 10-20 degrees comming to an almost perfect north direction andproceeded out of sight into the clouds along the north horizon.I need to note here that it is uncanny how familiar it is to the looks of a satellite in orbit. We both had the perception that the object was VERY far away. With the exceptionof a few low clouds, it was VERY dark and MANY stars were visible. I think city lights (like from Houston 60 miles away) would easily have drowned out the light.its my personal view that the object was not in our atmosphere.Also, i emphasize that every single turn it made had no &apos;curves&apos; in them. If you drew a right angle, thats the path it was following.I would have been more skepticle of what we saw, but increadibly, there was a report the following monday (we saw it on the first saturday morning following memorial day)in the Houston Chronicle (June 2nd i believe) reporting that there were 16 reported sightings of a UFO from Galveston Island. This island is approx. 80-100 miles WNW of ourlocation.				0	3	6.9	430055	0.0000182	alien_abduction	0.008576329	0.012752647

19970922	19971112	St. Louis, MO	other	approx 1 hr	Summary : We had just moved into our new home and could not sleep.  At approx. 3:00 a.m. I noticed a glowing object in the eastern sky at about horizon level.  It was far enough away that when it moved around, the telephone and electrical wires were hiding it.  My husband asked me if I saw it and I told him yes.  We did not have the camcorder or binoculars unpacked, but we did have the site from his telescope.  You could see that the thing was changing colors from white to blue to green.  We live very close to an airport (practically at the end of the runway) and noted that there was no airplane activity.  This is very unusual for Lambert Field.  The next night at about the same time my husband and a friend saw the same light, but this time there were approx 3 objects doing the same thing as the night before.  They were convinved thath what they saw that night was a UFO.  My husband said they were much more active thath night than the night before when we saw it together.  I do not be! lieve it was a star and we have discussed if it was possible to be some type of new aircraft that McDonnell/Boeing could be testing.  We heard no noise or saw any other activity.

19940407	19970703	Brookfield, CT	light	0:00:30	Summary : Large, bright object crested over NW horizon moving very fast, my friend and I both saw the object, and another of my friends reported sightin the same object about 2 min. later coming from the same direction.One large, luminous sphere apeared over the Northwest horizon directly in front of my friend and I, the diameter of the light itself would have easily covered the moon.The light was traveling over 100 MPH, at an altitude of only about 1000 feet yet did not make any sound.  If the object were a helicopter or an airplane, we would have easily heard it.  The light was similar in size and shape to the objects that appeared over Phoenix 2 weeks ago.  At the time, we were both students In Brookfield.  I was 10 years old, and my friend was 11 years old.  We had gone outside to &quot;look for&quot; UFOs, but we were not prepared for what we saw that night.  I am only submitting this information after the occurrance of a similar sighting over Phoenix, AZ.  Thank you.

I looked down toward the busy highway and saw this bus like thing above the highway. I squinted and looked again. It was still there. In this valley, there are many dogs but they were not making a peep for hours. A few seconds later the valley erupted with many dogs going crazy all at once. I told my girlfriend Ester to come out and look. I said &quot;do you see that thing down there?&quot; She said yes, what is that? I said I don&apos;t know. It looked like a big bus with lights moving slowly out of our view above the highway. Was I drunk or what? I know all about planes, etc. but was I seeing things or what?

I work the early morning shift and at this time of year the sun hasn&apos;t risen yet.  I have been watching the sky a lot lately due to some very strange looking airplane lights, we have had a great deal of air activity lately.  Anyway, was watching a regular plane flying in the North and then I turned around to take the unleaded gas reading when I looked up and saw an auburn red dot floating across the sky.  At first I thought it was a falling star, because there was no sound, but then it darted to the left, not slightly it was a very fast long movement, and then it just disappeared.  It was very graceful and strange to stay the least.  My descriptions is a single working Mom.  I don&apos;t know if this is something or not, but I hope it helps.

After about  1 1/2 minutes stationary, the object suddenly darted off at a slightly ascending angle emitting a  noise similar to a jet aircraft. Observed flight-in-motion time approximately 4-5 seconds before disappearing behind a stand of trees. The color of the lights was very bright pale yellow.

19971114	19971116	North Camano Island - Buena Vista  area- above Utsalady Bay, WA	formation	20-60 seconds	Summary : Double line of bright, ember hot colored lights. From W. to E. Most amazing was the dark grey colored object in the wake of these. Looked like zepplin, going as fast as the lights. Blinked out one by one including the grey object.  Object was illuminated by these lights only - no internal or external lights of it&quot;s own. No sound or only faint hum.  Were we the only ones who saw this special object? Still having a hard time believing this part of what I clearly saw.The lights were numbered in the dozens, bright hot, ember or candle glow colored.  ran in a fast parrallel line from the West toward the East.  We are high above the water of Utsalady and Skagit Bays with a clear, unobstructed view across Skagit Bay and northward toward Anacortes. Appeared to be closer then is being reported.  If these were high in the atmosphere, then the grey object that was moving with these lights had to be hugh.  Because it was close enough to be illuminated by these lights.  Only a jet could have kept pace with these lights, I saw no wings, no undercarriage as on a blimp/zepplin.  ((Name deleted)) is an active 71 year old male.

The object was spherical in shape and appeared to be of metallic substance and reflectivity.I expected that this was an airplane and watched for it to turn, however after observing it for about one minute, I came to the conclusion that it was not going to turn.  It simply seemed to hover just east of Moffet fieldat an altitude of approximately 4-5000 feet.  After about 1 more minute, the object simply disappeared.While driving eastbound on Moffet Blvd from Mountain View towards Moffet field at 6:48p.m., I observed what I first thought to be an airplane.

19941205	19970808	Sumter, SC	circle	10 min	Summary : Large object no engine noise, hovering 75 yards away. producing a light that made no shadows. after short hover time began climbing at rate i&apos;ve never seen before..This object was also reported to Shaw AFB. It appeared in the police blotter in the shaw spirit (base paper). I was watching TV when I saw a bright light come through my window. I looked out to see who was shining it in my house when i noticed a hovering object circular in shape approximately 75 yards away. I immediately went to wake my wife so she could also see it. Returning to the window I noted that the object was beginning to lift higher. returning to my bedroom i again tried to wake her. this time she came in but it had already climbed high enough that only if you knew what you were looking for could you see it. I didn&apos;t say anything more about it till i saw it in the base paper. then i told my wife the details. It made no sound, and the light it gave off made no shadow. It climbed at a rate no jet I&apos;ve seen can make. 2 weeks after this event my neighbors were over for dinner, they breached the subject by saying &quot;your gonna think we&apos;re crazy. But we saw a UFO in your yard just 2 weeks ago.&quot;. Needless to say we exchanged our views of that night and they matched exactly. My background is a avionics Technician for the ((Deleted)). I was in the airforce for ((Several--# deleted)) years. I was retired medically for a injury incurred from a ((Reason deleted)). Which brings up another weird event. my 2nd day home from the hospital, i had a most troubling dream that i was being dragged from bed and dragged through some tall grass toward a bright light. I awoke that morning and woke the wife to go make breakfast, as i sat up she asked what was on my back. Then she brushed off a handfull of grass seed... I told her about that nights dream. and we both agreed it was weird. She says she remembers waking that night and i wasn&apos;t in bed, she thought i was on the computer so gave no thought to it. when we entered our front room, my brother 14 years old, was sleeping on the couch. he asked where we went last night. We said no where, why? He said he heard the door open and close once, like someone had left but never heard anyone return.

19970331	19970422	Juneau, AK	light	approx  2hrs	Summary : A friend and I saw a strange low altitude bright object flashing orange and green rotating colors on Easter night in Juneau,Alaska. When seen through my telescope (wewere looking at the comet and the planets),it had this strange light and dark light,pattern or field around and above it, likelight defraction patterns. No other starswere as low or had that effect. I could notsee colors with telescope. Only by naked eyeobservations.I was visting a friend and she and I werelooking at the comet on Easter night andshe said hey, look at that satellite! I wasfacing north and I focused my Meade telescopeon it. It was flashing orange and green in arotating fashion...I then looked at itthrough my scope and to my surprise I couldntdetect the colors!Instead it had this really weird lightfield...of dark and bright lines above andaround it...like a light defraction pattern.The object was really bright white with thosestrange lines going around it in a strangestriped pattern. The colors could not bedetected with the scope! I then thought itwas my lens so I focused on a bright star andthe patterns were not present on anything else!When I looked again with just my eyes I sawthe flashing rotating orange and green lightsbut when I used the scope, all I saw was thestrange dark and light patterns. It was lowin the sky, and stationary. I was facingnorth and it was to my right. I looked at itoff and on for about 2 hrs. while checkingout the comet and mars.I went home, I live a block away, and when Igot to my house and looked up again to find it,it was not there--to my right! I was stillfacing north. I looked to my left and thereit was! It was so close(low)that a one blockdrive was enough to move it over. So it meansit was positioned in between my friends houseand mine! I dont think high altitudegeosynchronistic satellites would be lowenough to cause that much of a difference ifI moved only a block away! Plus later, after2 days of clouds, it was no where to be seen!Ive never seen anything out of the ordinarybefore. I know what venus and mars and theother planets look like through my scope, soI&apos;m sure it wasnt a planet!My friend saw the colored lights, cause shepointed it out to me, but she went intoher house while I stayed outside and lookedat the sky and the &quot;object&quot;. It was too coldfor her! I didnt really think too much aboutthe strange erie lights until I got home andrealized that the object was WAY TOO LOW,cause it moved to my left, to be a satellitelike my friend first thought it was.

Then, my friends went along their own ways, and I was looking at it still, I lost sight of it at times, but I always fouind it. When it was above me, I saw that the bottom was circular, with three &quot;Lights&quot; or something making a triangle.  Before that, I saw that it was &quot;flashing&quot; too.My friend, ((Name deleted)) saw it first. He was saying to me, &quot;look at that shiny thing in the sky.&quot; And I looked, and I saw nothing, so I said, &quot;I can&apos;t see it.&quot; Then I found it, and I was staring at it for a good minute there.It was moving around in a way I don&apos;t think anything on earth can do. And then, I pointed it out to my other friend, Amanda, and she saw it too. We were running the mile, because it was PE, and so ((Two names deleted)) jogged off. But I was still looking at the object. the side of the object was weird, i can&apos;t really describe it. When the object was above me, I could see the bottom was circular, and there were three &quot;lights&quot; forming a triangle. I had to at least jog for the mile, so I looked away for a moment and started to jog. When I looked back, It wasn&apos;t there.

There speed was about the same as one of our aircrafts.  We used binoculars. but could not tell if each unit of V-shaped lights were connected or separate.  Since the whole array covered a huge area of sky, we think each v- shaped unit was independent.

19970626	19970627	Pretoria (South Africa),	light	10-15 sec	Summary : Bright, arc-white light observed moving fromWSW to ENE at high speed. Altitude roughly500 metres (1500 feet). Distance at start ofsighting roughly 5 KM (8 mi.), distance atend of sighting roughly 8 KM (12 mi.)Light seemed to have tinges of colour at certain points in sighting: pink, red, orange. Speed comparable with Mirage F1 CZ at Mach 1+.I stepped out of my back door, and as is myhabit, I scanned the range of hills roughly1 KM north of my house. I observed thislight moving in the direction indicated (WNWto ENE), and when first observed, the objectappeared just above the hills to the West,altitude about 500 metres. Object moveddiagonally across my line of sight until Ilost it behind the hills directly North ofmy position. From what I can therefore extra-polate, it moved roughly 9 KMs in 10-15seconds. That&apos;s about between 2100 and 3200KM per hour (1300 mph - 2000 mph). No soundwhatsoever, but at Mach speeds. Should havecaused a sonic boom, at that altitude.Light was extremely bright, white: almost likean arc-light. No strobes or pulsation, justthe slight colour change that could have beendue to haze or pollution (it&apos;s winter here, and at 18:30it&apos;s just gone fully dark).My background: 35 year old male.Current occupation:((three lines of credentials deleted)).

19971114	19971117	Snohomish, WA	formation	10 seconds	Summary : Large object seen traveling northeast at a slow rate of speed approximately 300-500 feet above the ground and 250 to 300 yards from observer.  Object was rectangular, and was about the size of a football field.  Appeared to be translucent with reddish/orange lights of different intensity surrounding the perimeter, however, the dark superstructure could be seen, outlined by the lights.  4 observers saw the object, 2 of which pursued in a car but could never regain sight.  3 observers later made schetches of the object without the others input.  All were strikenly similar.UFO sighting November 14th, 1997.  XXXXX 86th St. S.E. Snohomish,  Wa. 98290. 9:10 P.M. My wife ((deleted)) was in the hot tub outside at the time and my four sons and myself were inside the house.  My wife appeared at the front door very excited/frantic calling for us to come outside.  When I got outside she pointed to the northeast and sad in a load voice &quot;Whats that!!&quot;  I didn&apos;t answer her at the time because I was in awe of what I was seeing.  My 12 year old son ((Name deleted)) and my 16 year old son ((Name deleted)) had also come outside with me and were witness to this event as well.  My wife was viewing this object for about 1 to 2 minutes before she summond me.  During this time the object looked very different.  She described it a appearing as a white ball with flames or trails of sparks shouting out behind it.  When I first saw it the object was travelling northeast at a slow rate of speed approximately 300 to 500 feet above the ground.  The object was large (about the size of a football field) and appeared to be translucent.  Weather at the time was extremely clear with the tempe! rature between 35-40F.  Multiple lights surrounded the perimeter (reddish/orange) and varied in intensity.  The dark outline of the superstructure could be seen outlined by the lights.  Object was 200-250 yards from our position of observation.  No sound eminated from the object and there was no other noise (cars, planes, stereos, etc.) at the time.  It was very quiet.  Object was pursued in a vehicle but sighting was not regained.  Various news reports speculated that the sighting was due to Leonid Meteor shower or a Russion spacecraft reentering earths atmosphere.  Meteors do not fly subsonically in formation horizontally for 10 seconds.  It was not that.  While there was a Russian spacecraft that did reenter the earths atmosphere and was seen by many people on the west coast at about this time, the reckage supposedly ended up in the Pacific ocean.  The object we saw was traveling northeast,  had a very clear symmetry/structure and was close enough to us for us to  want to p! ursue it.  I have read many books on astronomy and the UFO phenomenon and have worked at The ((Name deleted)) Company for 18 years as a business analyst.  This sighting did not have anything to do with the Leonid meteor shower, Russian space junk or planes flying in formation!

19910201	19970630	Quartzite (20 miles east of), AZ	light		Summary : Large object with a row of white lights on one side and row of red lights on other (about six each) hovering over rest stop in Arizona, February 1991.I read with interest your news releases about the sightings in Arizona in March 1997.  My husband and I were traveling to Tucson in February 1991 on a very dark night.  At about 10:00 I noticed a row of lights in the distance.  I thought there must have been a house on a hill with all its lights on.  It looked like it was about a mile or so away.  As we approached it appeared that the brightness of the lights suddenly increased, as if the &quot;house&quot; had tilted.  We approached a rest stop, about 20 or 25 miles east of Quartzite, Arizona, where the lights were hovering.  There were about six white lights in a row.  Since it was so dark I thought they were some high antennas over the rest stop.  I could see no object, only the lights.  We had never been there before and were not familiar with the area.  There were also two smaller red lights in the area that seemed to be slowly moving.  Since our car was traveling at about 65 miles per hour, I thought they were also antennas, but !thought it was odd that they seemed to be moving.  As we passed the white lights, I said to my husband, who was driving, &quot;There are some strange lights up there.&quot;  He only had an opportunity to glance up and see the white lights, but since they were quite high in the sky, perhaps 100 feet, he only saw them momentarily. As we passed, I looked back, and there were the same number of red lights on the other side, which were blinking somewhat randomly, not in any pattern.  We continued on to Tucson, and I asked someone who was familiar with that road if they ever saw any odd lights at that rest stop, and he said he thought he had, so I dismissed them as antennas.  On the way home, we took at good look at that rest stop during the day, and there were no high antennas and no hills or mountains nearby.  We have been on that road several times since then, and once we took a frontage road near that rest stop and noticed there was a power plant about 1/4 mile from there that could not b!e seen from the highway.  Last February my husband and I again traveled to Tucson at night and stopped at that rest stop to get a few hours sleep.  The only lights we saw were some red ones on a low post that were more or less vertical, and definitely much closer to the ground than the ones we had witnessed that night.  We have mentioned the sighting to a few people but never have officially reported it.				0	0	1.1	0	0.000011	flying_saucers	0.005701254	0.019183656		
19940601	19970810	Christchurch (New Zealand),	sphere	5.00 min	Summary : Driving around Witch Hill area of Banks Penninsula, passed strange. There were 3 lights, not completely certain of their colour, They were in a stationary position. There was another white light which zig zagged around the stationary lights, and this light would move from extremely bright to dim, this light merged with the stationary lights, then a white flourecent looking ball appeared and passed us, dissappearing below the horizon of the hill, none of the lights made any sound, I ran to get a closer look at the lights, the other two were insistant that we get back in the car and drive around the Penninsula to get a closer look, we never sighted the lights again. This was all close proximity, approx 100-200 m.I really wish we had a video camera with us that night!!!					0	1.1	0	0.000016	alien_abduction	0.008344924	0.015727535

Noneof the witnesses talked witheachother so no information wasexchanged.  Tom and Mary calledthe local paper, the DailyRepublic and a small articlewas written.No other witnesses have beenfound yet, however, CharlieGoodyear whom wrote the articlefor D.R. stated that he hadtalked to a Capt. Robert Kirbyat Travis. In his article hestates, &quot;Officials at TravisAir Force Base did get onephone call around 10:30 p.m.Saturday from an unidentifiedwoman reporting a mysteriouslight in the sky.  But airtraffic controllers and basepersonnel noticed nothingunusual, Capt. Robert Kirbysaid.&quot;  When I interviewed Tomhe stated, &quot;They couldn&apos;t havemissed it if they were evenlooking out the window!  Theywould have needed sunglasses!&quot;Charlie Goodyear checked withlocal police and sheriff&apos;sdept. and found there were noreportings of the anamoly. Ichecked with the local firemarshall whom is in charge of,and lives in, the range landswhere the incident occured.  Hestated he was not aware of theoccurance or anyone reportingit, but would call me if heheard anything.According to the witness&apos;sdescriptions, this light didnot move across the sky and didnot seem to originate from aphysical object, but simplyexisted as its own source withno density. No noise could beheard and it did not travel ormove from its active location.It would however, shift andtransform from being round(size of dime), then enlargingto round (silver dollar), thenwould stretch out &quot;like gum&quot; inlength (dollar bill), thenseparating into two. Then itwould come back together like around dime and would then fadeout to size of a pinpoint, likea TV tuner turned off. Then itwould come back repeating theprocess. Witnesses stated thisprocess repeated about 6 times.One time upon separation, thetwo lights  moved diagonally toeach other, like a &quot;chevron&quot;with 2 strips, shimmering likea reflection on water.Eventually when fadeing itnever came back. While cloudswere scattered through the skysthe area where the lights wereshowing contained none. Tomstated he frequents through thearea quite often and is awareof regular air traffic due tothe AFB, however during thislight show no air traffic wasnoticed what so ever.The witnesses were interviewedtogether by phone.  Tom is 52,and is a grocer&apos;s clerk.  Maryis 50 and is a purchaser for anintercom company.  Both areinterested in spiritual/psychictype information, but do notkeep up with latest gossip orhappenings in that regard.Mary stated she did not read orwatch the news reports, andthat as she did not even knowabout the comet, until sheasked Tom one night what shewas seeing in the sky. Bothhave had a light interest inUFO&apos;s but again do not keep upwith latest gossip etc...Together through the interview,they seemed to mutually agreeupon their story, as theyshared enthusiasm andexcitement about it.  Neitherwould speculate as to what itwas they saw, except that theyboth &apos;felt&apos; it was not aterrestial source orphenomenon. Both did not feelfrightened by the expierienceand talked about it as apositive expierience. Therewere no physical effectsreported.  Witnesses reportedaprox. 5 vehicles passed onHighway 12 during theirstationary 5 miniute viewing.They found it strange that thevehicles passed as withoutnotice of the event. As ifobservation was limited only tothose who were there initially.The area in which this occuredis a rural area, consisting ofplains type terrain, coveringover 2000 sq miles.  Populationwithin the sighting area issparse, probably 1 ranch forevery 2 sq miles. Communitiesclose enough to have possiblywitnessed the light show wereBirdslanding, Rio Vista, Dixon,and possibly eastern Fairfieldand Suisun.  All aresurrounding the proximitywithin 15 miles.  Birdslandingis the closest within 5 miles.Attempts were made to locateaddtional witnesses with nosuccess. Contact was madeeither in person or by leavinga note, with ranches in theimmediate vicinity of thesighting location.Birdslanding, a rural communityof ranches, is directly acrossHighway 12,  may containwitnesses.  Many events of thisnature, in the past, have beenreported in the Birdslandingarea.  I made contact with thepostmaster for this area andgave her cards with a requestfor contact if she heardanything.  She readily agreed.I went out to view the site andcheck for any natural sourceswhich may explain this event. Idid so on 4/21 at 23:00 to gainperspective with a similarnight environment. It wasobserved that radio towersexisted aprox. 15 miles NE ofthe sighting area. Thesetransmission towers are highand thin.  2 of them had lightswhich were greenish and wouldflash on and off.  Both towerswere aprox. 3 miles apart andwould alternatly do this in aregular sequence.  Whileconsidering this as a possiblesource it was eliminated whilereinacting their viewpoint.The towers were to far off inan easterly direction and theirproximity to the horizon couldnever have contributed to thesize and altitude of the event.Additionaly the descriptionwhich was given did not matchthe constant sequence in whichthese towers flashed.Daytime observation of the areawas also made. No otherpotential sources were noted.Witnesses will provide markerdrawings in a followupinterview in two weeks.  Thisalong with any further datagathered will be forwarded atthat time.				0	4	7.7	403014	0.0000193	alien_abduction	0.001768868	0.037098609		
19971121	19971208	North Kingstown, RI	triangle	10sec or less	Summary : While driving at dusk my daughter and I noticed an airplaine flying up in the sky w/ it&apos;s lights on heading in an easternly dirtection to Green Airport.  We were driving on route 1 heading north onto route 4 Just as we came to a location on rt.4 near a combination miniture golf/batters cages/golf hitting range that is when we noticed the airplaine w/ it&apos;s lights on.  In this same are there are no tall trees and the area has a considerable panoramic view.  The air plaine was a couple hundred feet in the air, and I had a view of about  100 to 120 degrees.  A friend of mine has informed that jet airliners go a maximum speed of about 200-250 mph.  I would assume that the airplane was going less than 200 mph if it was heading for a landing at green.  No sooner than I had seen this plane I then saw another plane above the 1st,  it was 2 time the hight of the 1st it too had its lights on and both had a triangular look to then. BUT as I watched both airplane&apos;s the 2nd passed the 1st as if it was standing still.  W/ in  5 seconds it was compleatly out of my sight as it to headed easterly direction. I would estimate that the other plane?!?!? was going about 10 time the speed of the 1st.  Even my youg daughter mentioned &quot;look at that dad&quot;I have a back ground in science/natural history.  I have seen the jets at the airshows in the summer at Quonsett base at the old sea-bees base.  The only time I have ever seen them disappeare that fast, they were close to the  ground.  I would estimate that both objects were about 1000 feet to 1/2 a mile away. Since it was dusk and dark I could not see  much except that both had a grey outline and both had their lights on.  dividing my windsheld up into 10 units by the time the 1st airplaine went one unite the second had disappeared.  I would basicly estimate that the 2nd object/plane was going 10 times the speed of the 1st. So if the 1st plane was going about 180 to 200 mph then the 2nd&quot;plane/object&quot; was going about  1800 to 2000 mph or more.  I have never seen a &quot;plane&quot; dissapear from my field of view like that in my life.  I have never seen a ufo in my life but because of the speed that this &quot;plane&quot;  was  going and that it dissapeared out of my viewing area w/in 5 + seconds I thought I should report this. I do not want to leave my name because I have heard about another person who has witnessed triangular and cigar shaped ufo&apos;s here in RI and that this same person who has recorded these ufo&apos;s, has since reported them on line.  I was also told that since this person reported these sightings several months later but use his own computer.  Later I was told that the ufo reporter was literally  visited by people in a white lincoln and the &apos;visitors&apos; were taking pictures of this persons house.  These visitors stoped the picture taking only after having their picture taken by the person who made the ufo reporting.  I was also told that the visitors inthe white lincoln had no plates on it at all, because they had watched it arrive and leave.  In fact on its way in twords this persons house, a cop had stoped the white lincoln and then left the lincoln alone. Depending who these people  in the white lincoln are be it &quot;men in black&quot; or &quot;government military personell&quot; I for one do not want my life subject to what ever hell these people put  ufo reporters through. All my daughter knows of ufo&apos;s is what she saw in the men in black video, I don&apos;t want her or myself subjected to anysort of &quot;interogation terror tactics&quot;.  I asked her about the &quot;fast plane &quot; we saw the previous week and she didn&apos;t remember the sighting that we had made at all.

19961205	19970617	Toronto (Canada), ON		1-1.5 min	Summary : It was a fast flying object, which had about three extremely strong lights.  It was flying very high, and I noticed no noise.  It appeared to be on fire, for there was a flame coming out of the rear of the vehicle. I was waching TV and then suddenly every chanell became blurry.  I turned off the TV and went to listen to the radio but that didn&apos;t work either. I looked outside and there it was.					3	6.9	430055	0.0000182	alien_abduction	0.008576329	0.012752647

There were broken to scattered clouds atabout 2-3000 feet, and the light was visiblethrough the clouds, but obviously above them.Given the color, I assumed that some space &quot;junk&quot;had re-entered and, containing a lot of copper,was burning up on re-entry.  Based on the speedof the object, we thought it was going the speedof a meteor.  All observors are college educated:engineer, teacher, pilot, and others.  None hadbeen drinking.

19970305	19970322	San Francisco, CA	oval	2 minutes	Summary : 2 small (about 1 ft. long &amp; 200 ft. away at closest) dark objects circling each other then sped south,followed min. later by 2 more.Clear sky, not windy, facing west from roof of three story building during smoke break,saw two dark, slightly oblong objects (but evenly unlike a ballon that has one roundedside and one narrow side) caught my eye as they manuevered about each other about 200or more feet away.  The movements were smooth and not jerky or bobbing (like balloonswould do) then sped off to the south faster than any wind might propell them.  I waswishing I had a pair of binoculars as they grew smaller above a building to the south.When I first saw them circling each other it appeared almost as if they were linked bya tether since they moved in tandem, but then when their path became straight they seemedto be at a greater distance appart than if this were the case.  Strangely, a dark heli-copter was circling the area directly above the closest approach of the objects at the time.It performed a pretty tight loop that seemed to focus on the area and was quite low as well.I looked up at it only two or three times and didn&apos;t notice any markings.  It didn&apos;t strikeme as a traffic helicopter and was in the wrong location if it were so if they were doingtheir job.  After the sighting I pondered whether what I saw were ballons, but this possibilityjust didn&apos;t seem to fit.  I didn&apos;t notice any wind that could account for it and the windusually comes from the west off the coast.  These objects flew from north to south.  Asmentioned in the abreviated report, the first two objects were followed by two more on thesame path, but without any circling maneuvers.					4	7.7	403014	0.0000193	alien_abduction	0.001768868	0.037098609		
19950107	19971116	Lake Grove (Portland Metro), OR	disk	&lt; 1 min	Summary : Round silvery disk quickly passing from W to E in a straight lineI was enjoying the weather from my second- floor apartment deck on that fine Saturday July 1, 1995 afternoon. The 2pm (PDT) sky was partly cloudy, mostly evenly scattered cumulus with a clear blue sky behind them. I am sometimes given to looking straight up into the sky in search of high-flying raptors or other soaring birds. As I looked directly overhead,I noticed something moving well above the cumulus clouds. It was a silvery object about the size of a dime held at arm&apos;s length moving in an unwavering straight line from west to east. I watched as it passed behind the clouds which were moving so slowly as to appear to be completely still. I would not want to hazard a guess as to its altitude or airspeed. My first thought was that it was simply a weather balloon. (In fact, I&apos;m still leaning towards that explanation.) As I studied it I wondered if it was in fact not silver, but translucent. It had a bluish cast but was darker around a well-defined edge and had no irregularities in its shape or surface. However, a few things didn&apos;t rest well with me. I&apos;ve seen weather balloons in flight before and this wasn&apos;t like either of them. This was perfectly round and had no visible payload. The others I had seen weren&apos;t nearly so symmetrical and were visibly balloons with something suspended underneath. Also, given that this object was well above the clouds, it would have been a *very* large balloon. As far as I know, there aren&apos;t any launch sites west of Portland used for such launchings. (That may just be my ignorance in this instance; the only launch site for high- altitude balloons that I know of is near Palestine, Texas.) I found it odd that it moved so much faster than the lower clouds, though of course the possibility of the jet stream comes to mind. I was also impressed that it moved in such a straight line. It covered about 30 degrees of the sky in 4-5 seconds. It disappeared behind a solid line of clouds banked up against Mt. Hood and the Oregon Cascades to the east. I have no idea if this was a *real* UFO or not. In fact, the most remarkable aspect of this incindent may simply be that I saw an ordinary thing in a place most people wouldn&apos;t ordinarily look--straight overhead--without some other motivation. It just to be odd enought to warrant reporting to you. Had I known how to contact anyone regarding this prior, I would have. When the UFO Center was on the news with the space junk reentry story, I knew where to go. If you need more info, contact me via email.

19970424	19970424	New Brighton, MN	triangle	45 minutes	Summary : 20-35 triangular shaped craft sighting.Bright flashing lights at corners.13 yr old male 43 yr old female-Masters Degree(No previous sightings)13 yr old spotted bright light in east from interiorof the home.  Went to investigate and then saw a large object in the eastern sky.  He called his mother who also went to investigate.  The first and what would also be the largest of the craft was the firstlight seen.  It was the brightest light we had ever seen in the sky except sun and moon.  The craft was triangular in shape with lights on the corners.  When it was right overhead, a small triangular structure could be seen on the underside.  It hovered for a while and then was approached by another smaller craft.The large one began to turn north west and the smaller craft followed.  The craft abruptly turned and went due north.  Then after they were overthe horizon, more of the smaller sized craft began to be seen from the south moving north.They appeared one at a time in approx. two minute intervals.  It took them less than two minutes to go from horizon to horizon.  We had never seen any craft move that quickly.  Many of them maneuvered in distint manners:forward-reverse, forward-reverse; hover; very quick zigzag; 45+ degree banks in a matter of seconds:  almost as if a display.  Light pattern:  one light on one wing would flashand then the other two would follow.  Colors of the lights were white in front, blue and redon the sides and smaller amber to red on the inside of the triangle, making a perfect equilateral triangle inside the craft perimeter.Sound:  At first like a plane, but then a high pitched hum could be heard particularly when the craft was right over us.  A while afterwards,almost like blowing over the top of a tube.More than 20-35 of these were seen over the course of approximately 45 minutes, traveling from thesouth, some going northwest, some northeast, and some traveling directly overhead to the north.

19960901	19970620	Fort Collins, CO	disk	45 sec	Summary : 9/1/96 SIGHTINGAround 9:30 pm, Sunday, September 1st, 1996, my wife and I were in our backyard watching the sky.  This had become our custom following a previous sighting I had seen alone in early August, 1995.  We live in Larimer County, Colorado, just south of the city limits of Fort Collins, approximately 2 miles from the foothills in front of Horsetooth Reservoir. We were positioned in such a way that our field of vision was to the south.  The sky was so clear that night that we remarked that the Milky Way was visible.  There was no moon visible at that time, although about a hour later, there was a full moon.For no apparent reason I looked over my right shoulder toward the NNW and saw clear skies.  Suddenly appearing in my field of vision was an object moving at what I guessed to be at cloud height.  There was no sound and the object moved fluidly toward the SSE, in the direction of Denver. The leading edge of the object seemed to be lit - possibly by the moon which had not yet risen but which may have been lighting the leading edge of the object from the east.    Also for no apparent reason, my wife turned her head and looked over her shoulder toward the NNW.  After having first noticed clear skies, the object suddenly appeared in her field of vision.Just at the moment that I realized what I was seeing, I said to my wife, &ldquo;Do you see that?&rdquo;  Before I could finish the sentence, she responded &ldquo;God, I do.&rdquo;As we watched the object proceed toward the SSE, we had enough time to consider and reconsider what the object might be.  The object moved with the fluidity of a bird riding a thermal, but there was no evidence of any wing movement or a change in course that a thermal would create. The object was much too large to be a bird - at arms length it would take a baseball sized object to obscure its visibility.  The shape was reminiscent of the Batman symbol with a curving leading edge that almost made a half circle with a point in the center rear.  The object appeared to be more oval than round, wide rather than long, and the center point was less that half the radius of the implied oval shape.The object remained in our field of vision for 30-45 seconds, long enough to pick up, set, and focus a camera. (The prints came back black.)  There was enough time for the internal dialog of considering, &ldquo;Yes, I really see this - Yes, its really there&rdquo; to take place more than 4 or 5 times as we watched the object track directly overhead.  It then disappeared as suddenly as it appeared.  Our field of vision was such that we should have been able to track its movement longer than the object was visible.The object seen in the earlier sighting in August, 1995, was similar in size, height and flight path with the direction of travel being the reverse course, SSE to NNW.  The leading edge was illuminated by 4 rectangular blocks of light and the previously mentioned rear center point was not noticed.  The object also appeared and disappeared in the same sudden fashion at approximately the same positions in the sky.We would be interested in knowing if anyone else had observed this or similarly shaped sightings.  If so, please e-mail us at: ((email address deleted.))	Poudre Valley Hospital Heliport	0.834806927	328056	2.358672863	3	6.9	430055	0.0000182	alien_abduction	0.008576329	0.012752647		
19950503	19971130	Alden, NY	light	10-20 minutes	Summary : I was just about to goto bed and I looked out my window for some strange reason and I looked to the south and I saw this very bright light in the sky. The object was going up at a fast rate and when it went behind the clouds you could see the clouds! The object looked flat from a distance and it had no flashing lights on it to tell me that it was a airplane or heliocopter. It had two bright lights that were side by side with a small space in between. I opened my window and I couldn&apos;t hear a sound. I live in the country and there isn&apos;t a lot of noise that I hear besides crickets. It startled me a lot. When it reached a point in the sky, it sat there for a couple of minutes, pulsing with its lights. Then it moved very quickly over to the West and sat the for a couple minutes again pulsing. Then it got very bright and then it just disappeared.the object seemed very large and flat from a distance. There were two very bright lights side by side going upwards. no sound, no blinking lights to indicate it was a airplane or heliocopter. when it stopped, it was pulsing. very lightly. When the object was in the West, It got very bright it had a somewhat blue tint to the light when it got bright. and then it just disappeared.....

Summary : Man and woman observe cluster of about 8, motionless blinking blue lights (not in sync), lazer-like pulses of light between them, and ground hovering white light for 15 minutes.This event occured a little over two years ago while my then fiancee and I were camping in one of my favorite and extremely remote locations just north of Wupatki National Monument in Arizona.  We both witnessed the event for its duration and had both worked as National Park Rangers prior to this sighting.  I havn&apos;t reported this officially until now because I thought we were probably the only ones to see such a thing, and that few would believe us.  Recent news reports of sightings in that exact area promted me to write this in the case it could be helpful.  My fiance and I split up not too long after this event and havn&apos;t spoken since.  She could be contacted for independent verification, if someone wanted to do so.  She was really frightened by what happened and hence missed some of what I saw, but I think she saw the majority of what I am about to report.  The incidident:  I drove out cross-country to my favorite area in my 4Runner and parked it facing East, about 100 ya!rds from the edge of a long, low mesa extending North and South.  The landscape dropped off to the East towards the Little Colorado River and the Navajo Res.  We built a campfire near my lowered tailgate and began to enjoy the evening.  At one point, I was sitting on the tailgate facing West while my fiance was tending the fire.  I looked straight up at the sky, and in my peripheral vision caught sight of a blinking light.  At first, I just thought it was an airplane, but I noticed it wasn&apos;t moving at all.  Then, I noticed from 5-7 other blinking lights in the same general quadrant of the sky--and outstretched hand would probably &quot;capture&quot; the space they all occupied.  I think they were whitish blue, but they may have been light red (I&apos;m sorry, I really can&apos;t recall exactly) and were not blinking in unison.  None were moveing at all.  This is why I kept watching them and told my fiance to look at them.  Then, we saw a lazer-like pulse of light shoot from one to another.  I thi!nk I saw this happen 2, maybe 3 times.  Then we noticed a whitish yellow light--much like a distant headlight--travelling near the ground in the distance ahead (East) of us.  At first I thought it was a car or motorcyle--but I&apos;ve never seen any other person out as far as I went, and certainly never at night... About the time I was beginning to worry that it was someone travelling toward I light, it went up and then back down a few degrees offf the horizen.  It continued to repeat this as it travellied along.  Most of the terrain there is fairly level, so I started doubting it was a car.  I put out the fire and had my fieance turn off her headlamp (she was too scared to do so).  When I looked back at the whitish light, it was apparently moving in our direction--but I couldn&apos;t tell how far away it was...at one point I thought for certain it was only 50 yards in front of us.  But there was no sound at all, so I figured I must be wrong.  Then we looked back up to the sky to see if!the other lights were still there; they were.  But when we looked out to the East for the whitish light, it was gone.  Then I noticed the same bluish or reddish (I think blue) lights blinking in the NW sky!  They had moved from the SE to the NW.  And then, to the N, we saw the whitish light travelling along the ground again...going up and down periodically like no car or earthbound vehicle could have done.  I t was almost as if it was searching for something.  Then it disappeared and the lights in the NW sky were gone too.  We slept in the back of my truck and had a restless night&apos;s sleep.  It was the strangest thing I had ever seen (though we both did sight one UFO each when much younger).  I always wondered if the military was conducting some advanced lazer weaponry by sattelites--but this never does quite explain the white object hovering near the ground.....The next day, oberservations of the terrain in the directions we saw the white light made it even more clear that it!could not have been a vehicle.  Background information:  I was 33 at the time, and my fiance 29.  We both have bachelors degrees and some other training.  We were very healthy and didn&apos;t do any drugs or drink alcohol, etc.  We had each worked as National Park Rangers, and I was/am more of a skeptic than anything else.  I used to love to read the Skeptical Inquirerer!  Now I am more open to various possibilities, but I still thing it could have been some type of military operation.  I sure would like to know!  Hope this helpful in some way; if you need more into, please contact me at any time.				0	1	5.8	61018	0.000017	alien_abduction	0.012320329	0.010652726		
19970403	19970512	Seattle, WA	other	2-4min	Summary : I was on highway 520 going home and saw a black, silent &quot;elongated key&quot; shape traveling south over lake WA dissappered (cut into clouds)over Renton. I watched it as I was stuck in rush hour traffic.It was approxamatly 1 KM long and didn&apos;t seem to get smaller as it traveled away.the day was partially cloudy  yet clear I was travelling east on the floating deck of the 520 bridge I looked over to the right (south) and thought I saw a flock of birds however I realized it was something else. Black,silent and traveling south I noticed it over Medina and it went out over the middle of the lake then started traveling south until it dissappered (cut into the clouds) over Renton(WA)..

19971114	19971116	Mukilteo, WA	formation	1-2 minutes	Summary : Two large bright lights leading streams of hundreds, or many thousands of smaller bright lights, streaming across the sky.Driving home.  Saw the lights in the sky.  They were heading North horizontally arcoss the sky.  Very visible.  Other witnesses on the road in front of us thought they were UFOs bombs.  We didn&apos;t know, and we frightened.  When we lost sight of the lights it was not because they dissipated, but rather moved behind some trees and out of our range of vision.  Seemed to move faster than airplane, but much slower than shooting star. Local news is very vauge on what this could have been. Would like to find out more - what are the possibilities?  Wondering if it could have been a natural phenomenon, that no one has considered?  Could it be some military exercise, or experiment?  Mass in sky much larger than could be created by Russian rocket - mass would indicate debris from something the size of Washington State - can&apos;t think of anything man made that could have created that much debris in the sky, with the light so bright, rocket should have burnt out and dissipated.

19970806	19970807	Wichita, KS	light	15-30 seconds	Summary : Lights hanging in sky northeast of homeLeaving house for work and looked up into the sky.  Saw lights hanging in sky. 2 rows of dim lights parallel to each other (not blinking or flashing)and @ 3-4 second intervals, brighter lights tracked from right to left between the two rows of dimmer lights.  I was unable to see any structure either above or below the lights.  The morning sky was dark.  This object did not move or make any sound.  I decided to alter my route to work slightly to get a better look at the object and as soon as I had gotten into my car and backed out of the driveway and looked over my shoulder the object had vanished. There is an air force base in the southeast part of the city as well as a commercial airport to the west.  I often see and hear aircraft near my home, sometimes some pretty sofisticated types, like the wing.  But, the behavior of this object was unlike any aircraft I have ever seen.

19780109	19970703	Thousand Oaks, CA	circle	60 seconds	I awoke at 4:30 a.m. and was lying awake in bed looking out the window.  I saw a large round yellow glowing object close to the ground far off in the distance and did not take note of it because I thought it was a full moon close to the ground.  It was partially blocked by some thin trees.As I lay there, the object began to ascend very very slowly.  As it began moving, I jumped out of bed and ran to the window watching as it rose above the tree level and house level.  I cannot tell how far off it was -- perhaps a few miles.Once it finished rising, it sat in the sky for a few seconds not moving -- then in a split second shot off to the right, disappearing.  I ran out of my room, down the hall, and into the living room which was the direction that the object flew.  I looked out of the sliding glass door in the living room, but the object was gone.Again, it was just a round, glowing, yellow object, with no other distinctive features.I have only told a very few select individuals about this over the past almost 20 years -- people that I knew would at least believe that I was not lying to them -- even if they don&apos;t happen to believe in UFO&apos;s.  When I heard about your organization, I figured I would at least log this siting with you -- perhaps it can help you  in some way.

19970316	19970623	Salton Sea, CA	other	45 minutes	Summary : Saw across the Sea a big red flash, then white-orange orbs appear, about 10-15, not moving, all in a straight line except for one which was to the left which move horizontally towards the rest.  They stayed for about 15 minutes, then went out about the same time.  Then about 10 minutes later, appeared again all shifted over to the left.  Again, more large red flashes on the ground, the horizon.  No sound could be heard at all throughout the entire time.Started with a big red flash across the Salton Sea, the East side.  We were on the West visiting a friend.  Then, moments afterwards, bright white-orange glowing orbs began to appear in the sky, above the horizon.  Approximately 10-15, all lined up and appeared to not move -- they were more or less in a straight line.  Except for one larger one off to the left, which moved towards the others slowly.  We wathed for about 15-20 minutes, all trying to figure out what it was.  Could not hear any sound at all, even after the big red flashes.Then, saw another big red flash on the horizon, not in the sky.  Then, they went out all about the same time.  Two of us remained to see if the lights would come back.  They did.  But this time all shifted to the left.  Again in a straingt line and again the big red flashes on the ground.  They stayed for about 15 minutes, with one to the left noticiably moving, the others not moving, then went out again at the same time.  We left for home shortly thereafter.

Very slow moving.Four bright orange lights were seen just after sundown at about 30&apos; elevation looking to the North/North-East. They were in a trapazoid-type formation. We also noticed some smaller white lights appearing around the orange lights that looked as if they might have been associated in some way. The lights seemed to be moving very slowly toward the South. The formation gave the impression of a plane, only much, much larger.((NUFORC Note:  We believe the correct time of the sighting to have been approximatel 2030-2040 hrs..
