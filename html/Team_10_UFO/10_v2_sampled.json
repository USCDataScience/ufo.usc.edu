It was dark outside but the sky was complete clear except for stars(The moon was still below the horizon). I was looking out the window when I saw what appeared at first to be a low flying airplane, but the shape was odd. As it came closer I could tell it wasn&apos;t a plane so I grabbed a pair of binoculars from my closet and headed outside to take a look. By this time the object was coming directly over my house. It was a long hexagon shaped object with 6 large lights and several smaller illuminations. The two lights at the end points of the object were red, while the four lights that made up the center of the object were white. In the inner surface of the object were what looked like a smaller ring of lights, but the were very dim. These lights on the object were different from what a normal aircraft lights look like. First off, they did not blink. Second, the appeared diffused like the light from a LED, not the bright bulb type lights that you would see on a airplane. While the object was at a fairly high altitude I was able to see the actual body of the object. It was definitely a solid mass, hexagon in shape. I couldn&apos;t make out anything on the surface but it appeared to be a dark grey or black. The total time I could see the object was about 4 minutes. It didn&apos;t seem to be moving very fast but it velocity and direction were constant. The object also made almost no noise. I live 25 miles from Pittsburgh Intl. Airport so a lot of plane fly over head at a fairly frequent pace and you can hear the engine drone from miles away, but this thing made only a slight hum even as it flew away. If you would like a more in-depth description or drawing of what I saw let me know by e-mail and I can call or fax your office. I don&apos;t know if that makes any sense or not, or if you have had any other reports from the part of the country. I don&apos;t know what it was I saw but I can say for almost certain that it was not a airplane and not a blimp."}, {"jaccard_score": 0.004068522483940043, "image_captions": "", "education_rate": "1994278", "reported_at": "19970718", "per_capita_alcohol": "2.124131469", "description": "Summary : witnessed flashes of light like explosions along the West,East, and SouthWestern horizonsI, Steven, was camping out on top of a hill near a green water tank/well ,just outside of Linesville,Pa in Pine Township, myself , Mark, Micheal, Keith, Ryan, Regis, and thier sister Monique, were playing it tag, well it started to get late so Monique went to lay down , and myself and the others basically just hung around talking .Suddenly we noticed a flash of light coming from the sky behind us in the east , our backs were facing towards Linesville , when we turned around it appeared to be heat lighting so we shrugged it off .

He explained what he saw without even hearing the radio report.  After he told me what he saw, I told him that he matched the reports.  He is POSITIVE that it wasn&apos;t an airplane or a firework.  Other than that, he has no idea.  It isn&apos;t really that big of a deal to him.  He could care less.  I just find this facinating.

He saw it while station out on the KMOX building balcony as he waited for the Fair St. Louis fireworks to begin.  Try and contact him for more info.  They have a website.  Just search for KMOX.

Video shown on 2 different episodes of &quot;Unsolved Mysteries&quot;.In 1992, 4 of us were able to capture on video some of the maneuvers of the &quot;Area 51&quot; object.  It shows the craft hovering, then moving down the ridge line until it disappears.  Also on video, the morning sequence which showed the craft pulsate and become brighter.  This is the segment used on Unsolved Mysteries.  Once it became totally dark it was nearly impossible to capture all of the maneuvers on video.  This thing could go from horizon to horizon in just seconds.  It would fly just like a meteor, stop on a dime, then go in a completely different direction.  We all saw the craft become brighter,almost as if it were gaining energy, then shoot across the sky.  After doing several maneuvers, the light would become dim, then go out.  The other 3 said,&quot;it just disappeared&quot;, but I was looking thru binoculars and saw what appeared to be an egg shape craft with the slightest pearlescent green glow. I watchedit go out of range.  The craft would be gone for approx. 45 minutes, then at the exact same time, all 4 of us heared a high pitch frequency &quot;inside&quot; our heads.  Then instantly, the object would appear.  I saw thru the binos what appeared to be some sort of docking with a larger ship.  There were several smaller ships throughout the evening which appeared to me as if they were helicopters observing from a distance. I am a private pilot and a former Marine.  I&apos;ve spent alot of time around planes and helo&apos;s.  This main craft was definitely not one of those.  Finally, what seemed to bother all of us the most was toward dawn, the craft came to a stop, and almost appeared to mimic a star.

In Sunrise Fl. The highway that we were on runs north and south.To the west is all Everglades, to the east is Sunrise, Up in the sky way way west we saw a comet shaped object moving west to east in an arc shaped motion.It looked like a blueish sphere with a reddish comet-like tail.It was way too high to see any real detail. The object was moving at an incredable rate of speed. Suddenly the comet tail went out and all you could see was the blue orb. When the UFO was over the road (still way to high to see detail) the tail&quot;fired&quot; twice, like some kind ofafte rburners.And was rocketed out of sight to the east ina matter of seconds, way faster than anything either of us had ever seen.

One window in the center moved down.The round bottom displayed a metallic gold color. She viewed it from30ft.for 5-10 min. before it zig-zagged and shot up into the sky.I was facing north an object appeared to be hovering over a group of power lines in my backyard near a ten foot tall shed. When I saw the UFO, I felt as if I was being watched and I watched for about 5 or 10 minutes. I felt very scared  and I felt as if something drawed me outof my house. When I got outside, I saw this. (drawing will be sent later) I saw the window marked &quot;x&quot;    move open as if something was opening it. The window seemed to move  down like rolling down a car window. Teen states that at 2:15 on 8-20-1996 she was making frozen french fries and she felt drawn to go outside. She states that she never goes around back at night , but something drew  her out thereand when she looked up  she saw an object about 10 feet away  and 10-115ft. above her.&quot; well the object was really low and I saw alot of windows and appeared as if someone or something was opening it. But anyway, I nver believed in UFOs until recently. Anyway, the object was circular and the lights on the !UFO was orange, green, and reddish-orange color, but the bottom was a goldish metallic color which was a round shape. Anyway, I watched the object for a good5 or 10 minutes and then I went inside looked out the window and the object was still there but then it zig-zagged in a pattern and it was really fast and then it was gone! Then I went to bed aat about 2:45, it started about 2:15, &quot; as stated in writing by (name deleted) on August 20,1996. Note: I saw her the morning after she witnessed this and the first words out of her mouth were ,  I saw a UFO in my backyard last night. I have known her for about ten years as a neighborand I coukd tell something had happened to upset her. I sat with her and ner sister in my backyard for the day trying to calm her and asking her to write down what happened and to draw if she could the object. After a long day together she calmed down after talking about her experience. I must include that a Deputy Sheriff had been dispatc!hed to our town to look in a nearby woods after a sighting of 8 UFOsby her brother less than two weeks before. We tried to tell him what happened to her, but he didn&apos;t act interested. He just wanted to let me know he had checked out the woods at my request to the Sheriffs office and found nothing. He advised we find out who owns the woods so no one would possibly file a trespassing complaint on us for entering the woods about a week after the event became known. I checked with our County Courthouse Records and found a number of possible owners. I called each one to ask about ownership. A woman north of town told me the owner. I called the Sheriff&apos;s office back to let them know I had the owners name and then I called to get permission to reenter the woods for my husband to look around. There were some trees down in the woods, but it looked like someone had notched them out before they fell. There is an area in the woods that has a circular patch where no vegetation grows. It is barren. I had my family take pictures while in there , but when the!film was developed some prints  were lost.I still have some pictures of the teen boy standing at the end of the street and pointing to the woods he saw  light up red and where all the Ufo activity took place as described in a report filed to the Nat&apos;l UFO R.C. as having happened on Aug. 7,1996, The reports being filed with the Center for Aug. ,Sept., and Oct. 1996 by me  will include a map and drawing for each sighting as soon as I can redraw the original from my files. I am submitting a video for the Center to review for the events that happened on Oct.18,1996. I am trying to get that tape ready to mail this weekend 1-04-1997 and will include the written report to you as soon as possible using your very handy on-line report form.Thanks so much to all of you there for helping us here in Ohio with all the problems we are encountering here of late in our backyards and over our houses.Take Care all of you and a special thanks goes to Mr Gribble, not Gripple. Please excuse my wro!ng pronunciation of your name. You should have corrected me. Thans not only for the time and trouble to look at and have analyzed the video tapes  I&apos;ve been sending , but for having founded the Center in the first place. I&apos;m only sorry to have been such a troublesome part of your life in 1996, maybe I can help in the future by filing things electronically now. Thanks again to all of you so much for your help and to Mr. Davenport, I ask you to forgive me for calling in at pesky hours of the morning.

The speed with which the object moved was incredible.  At this time I pointed it out tomy friend  He also looked up and was immediately transfixed.  I am unsure of the exact length of time that we watched the objects, because the event was eleven months ago, but it was probably about sixty seconds.

I looked up with my binoculars to get a better look and I could see 4 lights, shaped like a triangle with 1 of the lights sort of trailing off the back right one, closer to it than the rest were to each other.

We were driving on route 1 heading north onto route 4 Just as we came to a location on rt.4 near a combination miniture golf/batters cages/golf hitting range that is when we noticed the airplaine w/ it&apos;s lights on.  In this same are there are no tall trees and the area has a considerable panoramic view.  The air plaine was a couple hundred feet in the air, and I had a view of about  100 to 120 degrees.  A friend of mine has informed that jet airliners go a maximum speed of about 200-250 mph.  I would assume that the airplane was going less than 200 mph if it was heading for a landing at green.  No sooner than I had seen this plane I then saw another plane above the 1st,  it was 2 time the hight of the 1st it too had its lights on and both had a triangular look to then. BUT as I watched both airplane&apos;s the 2nd passed the 1st as if it was standing still.  W/ in  5 seconds it was compleatly out of my sight as it to headed easterly direction. I would estimate that the other plane?!?!? was going about 10 time the speed of the 1st.  Even my youg daughter mentioned &quot;look at that dad&quot;I have a back ground in science/natural history.  I have seen the jets at the airshows in the summer at Quonsett base at the old sea-bees base.  The only time I have ever seen them disappeare that fast, they were close to the  ground.  I would estimate that both objects were about 1000 feet to 1/2 a mile away. Since it was dusk and dark I could not see  much except that both had a grey outline and both had their lights on.  dividing my windsheld up into 10 units by the time the 1st airplaine went one unite the second had disappeared.  I would basicly estimate that the 2nd object/plane was going 10 times the speed of the 1st. So if the 1st plane was going about 180 to 200 mph then the 2nd&quot;plane/object&quot; was going about  1800 to 2000 mph or more.  I have never seen a &quot;plane&quot; dissapear from my field of view like that in my life.  I have never seen a ufo in my life but because of the speed that this &quot;plane&quot;  was  going and that it dissapeared out of my viewing area w/in 5 + seconds I thought I should report this. I do not want to leave my name because I have heard about another person who has witnessed triangular and cigar shaped ufo&apos;s here in RI and that this same person who has recorded these ufo&apos;s, has since reported them on line.  I was also told that since this person reported these sightings several months later but use his own computer.  Later I was told that the ufo reporter was literally  visited by people in a white lincoln and the &apos;visitors&apos; were taking pictures of this persons house.  These visitors stoped the picture taking only after having their picture taken by the person who made the ufo reporting.  I was also told that the visitors inthe white lincoln had no plates on it at all, because they had watched it arrive and leave.  In fact on its way in twords this persons house, a cop had stoped the white lincoln and then left the lincoln alone. Depending who these people  in the white lincoln are be it &quot;men in black&quot; or &quot;government military personell&quot; I for one do not want my life subject to what ever hell these people put  ufo reporters through. All my daughter knows of ufo&apos;s is what she saw in the men in black video, I don&apos;t want her or myself subjected to anysort of &quot;interogation terror tactics&quot;.

A telescope revealed a round shape.I observed what I took to be a satellite, until it shifted direction, and then stopped.  It was slightly brighter than the brightest stars in the sky, and not an unusual color.  It would hover for awhile, then move, sometimes appearing to spin in circles.  I first looked at my watch at 19:11, after having watched the object for perhaps 10 minutes.The object hovered in basically the same part of the sky for over three hours, at times appearing to drift, and then bring itself back to where it was before.  It often just hovered perfectly still, and looked like a star. It was roughly overhead of Alta, very high, a little  to the northeast.  Witnesses who saw it move included a member of the Alta Fire Department, a dispatcher for the Alta Marshall&apos;s office,And two members of the astronomical society at the Hansen Planetarium in Salt Lake.  They happened to have a nice 3inch wide telescope, and were photographing the moon.  With a higher powered eyepiece, the telescope showed the object to be pefectly round, with a darker round circle in the center.  I think the telescope was about 12000x, if I recall correctly.  The object was absolutely still in the telescope.I think the image in the telescope was consistent with looking up at the underside of a perfectly round flying saucer.  No lights were apparent on the object.  It appeared to be reflecting light from the sun which gave it the appearance of a star to the naked eye.

The observers immediately developed the impression that the third &quot;aircraft&quot; was being pursued by the first two they had witnessed.  The third object was less well illuminated that the first two, and its lighting pattern consisted of three red, somewhat &quot;subdued&quot; lights, arranged in a triangular pattern. Its size was approximately that of the other two aircraft. Approximately 30-60 seconds after the observers had spotted the first two conventional aircraft, they suddenly noticed that a third aircraft was flying from the northwest directly toward the triangular aircraft, apparently on a &quot;collision&quot; course with it, closing from the starboard side of the triangular-shaped aircraft, and flying at a somewhat higher speed that the triangular ship exhibited. Within seconds of sighting the fourth aircraft, the observers realized that none of the conventional aircraft were able to keep up with the triangular craft, all of them beginning to fall behind at the latter apparently began to accelerate.  The third conventional aircraft fell behind the triangle, and began to fly parallel to the other conventional aircraft.

It appeared to be like an &quot;amoeba&quot; containing lights of red, blue and white.  It seemed there was distortion and the lights varied in position as if mildly bouncing yet constrained by individual points and still all part of the same object.  That described distortion was nothing like atmospheric and since I spotted the polar ice cap and terrain colors in a town near Houston, it seems odd.  I knew I was seeing something extraordinary and allowed my wife to look into the eye piece as I spun the declination knob at an appropriate speed.  Apparently I had only captured part of the object since she described the end section I had described plus a disc of lights numbering a dozen, half circle of red and half blue with two white lights!opposite each other outside of the circle.  Further, there were two fainter lights inside the circle and one outside towards the trailing section.  She reported sharper detail in some of the lights.

This had become our custom following a previous sighting I had seen alone in early August, 1995.  We live in Larimer County, Colorado, just south of the city limits of Fort Collins, approximately 2 miles from the foothills in front of Horsetooth Reservoir. We were positioned in such a way that our field of vision was to the south.  The sky was so clear that night that we remarked that the Milky Way was visible.  There was no moon visible at that time, although about a hour later, there was a full moon.For no apparent reason I looked over my right shoulder toward the NNW and saw clear skies.  Suddenly appearing in my field of vision was an object moving at what I guessed to be at cloud height.  There was no sound and the object moved fluidly toward the SSE, in the direction of Denver. The leading edge of the object seemed to be lit - possibly by the moon which had not yet risen but which may have been lighting the leading edge of the object from the east.    Also for no apparent reason, my wife turned her head and looked over her shoulder toward the NNW.  After having first noticed clear skies, the object suddenly appeared in her field of vision.Just at the moment that I realized what I was seeing, I said to my wife, &ldquo;Do you see that?&rdquo;  Before I could finish the sentence, she responded &ldquo;God, I do.&rdquo;As we watched the object proceed toward the SSE, we had enough time to consider and reconsider what the object might be.  The object moved with the fluidity of a bird riding a thermal, but there was no evidence of any wing movement or a change in course that a thermal would create. The object was much too large to be a bird - at arms length it would take a baseball sized object to obscure its visibility.  The shape was reminiscent of the Batman symbol with a curving leading edge that almost made a half circle with a point in the center rear.  The object appeared to be more oval than round, wide rather than long, and the center point was less that half the radius of the implied oval shape.The object remained in our field of vision for 30-45 seconds, long enough to pick up, set, and focus a camera. (The prints came back black.)  There was enough time for the internal dialog of considering, &ldquo;Yes, I really see this - Yes, its really there&rdquo; to take place more than 4 or 5 times as we watched the object track directly overhead.  It then disappeared as suddenly as it appeared.  Our field of vision was such that we should have been able to track its movement longer than the object was visible.The object seen in the earlier sighting in August, 1995, was similar in size, height and flight path with the direction of travel being the reverse course, SSE to NNW.  The leading edge was illuminated by 4 rectangular blocks of light and the previously mentioned rear center point was not noticed.  The object also appeared and disappeared in the same sudden fashion at approximately the same positions in the sky.We would be interested in knowing if anyone else had observed this or similarly shaped sightings.

The object apparently was capable of &quot;jumping&quot; suddenly, perhaps as much as 20 or 30 miles within 1 second time.  The crew requested clearance to descend, which they did.  they descended to 9500 feet, but the object appeared to descend with them, staying on their now, &quot;12:00&quot; position.

They were&nbsp;flying at an altitude normally too low for conventional aircraft.  Too slow for an airplane. . .almost as if they were gliding.  They made no sound.On the evening of January 12, 1997 around 11 pm I was at my girlfriend&apos;s house and went outside to try to start her car (it had been very cold that week and we had been trying to start it for a couple of days).  I went inside the car, tried to turn it on and it didn&apos;t start.  I got out of the car and two bright lights hovering over a set of trees caught my attention.  I knew that there were no lights (city or otherwise) that should have been there so I looked at them for a second or two.  They were really bright but at the same time kind of dull (hard to describe).  I moved a few steps away from the car and they started to move in a northeasterly direction.  When I first spotted the lights they were probably 1/4 to 1/2 a mile away.  I ran inside and told my girlfriend to come out and check them out.  She got on her boots and saw them but went back inside because it was at least 10 degrees below zero outside.  I ran out onto the street and followed their flight path.  They fl!ew from a southwest to northeast direction and were probably 60-70 degrees off of the horizon.  The two lights upon closer inspection appeared to be made up of more than one light, possibly five. . .occasionally they would blink (they blinked quickly, unlike any other airplane light I have ever seen)  The thing that struck me the most is how they stayed _perfect_ formation. . .not straying an inch from their formation.  It was as almost they were part of the same craft.  This might be the case, but if this is so that means that this craft was at least the size of 2 football fields.  They were completely silent.  Billings is set against a continuous series of cliffs which are about 60-100 feet in height.  In comparison to the Rims (as they are called) they were about 200 feet off of the ground.  They were flying too slow for any airplane that I know  of (plus, as i said they made no sound)  It was if they were gliding.  I ran up a side street and watched them pass over the rims!and pass just south of the airport, if not right over it.  I watched them glide off until they went over the horizon.  It was very strange, as the entire time I knew this was something that I have never seen before in person.  I tried to call the airport to confirm any unidentified aircraft but couldnt get through.

Light streams from it along with motor noise.  Closes again and leaves no sign of existence.The following event has been something I have kept quiet about for almost one and  a half years.  It was not until I read an account on this site about a UFO sighting east of my area on 11-27-95 that I realized it might be UFO related.The  phenomena occurred on the night of 11-27-95.  At that period my wife and I would often walk around the hills of our small mountain town during the evening.   It was near 8 PM when we were ascending up a small gulch to the NE of our town.  I happened to look up the east hill slope and saw a large black area.  At that moment a light came on  in the area: it was a large hole in the ground about 50 feet long and maybe 30 feet wide.  It was slightly above us and about 170 feet away.   There was for a short time the sound of a motor, like that of an air-compressor.  The sound was a steady &lsquo;puut puut puut puut&rsquo; like a one cylinder engine.  The light illuminated the sides of the hole (actually it was very bright) and we saw the fresh surface of broken rock around the hole&apos;s sides.  As we continued to ascend the gulch I told my wife that it was probably the site of a new house being built.  I figured that it was a hole for a basement.  The light was bluish-white like that seen in !the older mercury vapor lights.  The motor sound only lasted a minute and once the light went off only come on again.  I assumed that the owner was in the hole doing work.  Other than wondering how such a hole was dug into solid sandstone I gave no special thought to the event.  I almost decided to walk over and look in but decided not to since the owner might not want me on his land.  We ended up seeing the hole from several heights (both from below and slightly above) and several angles as we walked on towards home.  Several months passed.  On 3-10-96 it was a fine Spring morning and my wife and I decided to go up and see how the new house was coming along.  As we topped the rise above the small gulch all that met our eyes was a smooth hillside covered with old weeds and grass with a few small stones.  Nothing appeared to have been moved for decades!

Could have been 5-6  objects clustered into one unit; or just one object.  May have had something hanging down from it (rope-like); but I was looking through open blinds that, of course, have cords that run vertically connecting them; so hard to tell.  Sat up to look more closely, and object slowly moved past upper left corner of window out of sight.  Today I heard about &quot;comets or space debris&quot; seen in sky here around 2115  last night.

When I first saw it the object was travelling northeast at a slow rate of speed approximately 300 to 500 feet above the ground.  The object was large (about the size of a football field) and appeared to be translucent.  Weather at the time was extremely clear with the tempe! rature between 35-40F.  Multiple lights surrounded the perimeter (reddish/orange) and varied in intensity.  The dark outline of the superstructure could be seen outlined by the lights.  Object was 200-250 yards from our position of observation.  No sound eminated from the object and there was no other noise (cars, planes, stereos, etc.) at the time.  It was very quiet.  Object was pursued in a vehicle but sighting was not regained.  Various news reports speculated that the sighting was due to Leonid Meteor shower or a Russion spacecraft reentering earths atmosphere.  Meteors do not fly subsonically in formation horizontally for 10 seconds.  It was not that.  While there was a Russian spacecraft that did reenter the earths atmosphere and was seen by many people on the west coast at about this time, the reckage supposedly ended up in the Pacific ocean.  The object we saw was traveling northeast,  had a very clear symmetry/structure and was close enough to us for us to  want to p! ursue it.

I witness a small (star-sized) orange light travel roughly east to west(top to bottom of eyepiece) in about 3/4 of a second.

The objects swung around, changing position with one another, then the top object vanished.  The other remained visible as we traveled forabout 20 miles.I was driving, and my friend ((name delted)) was a passenger.  We were on Route 8, on our way from Naugatuck, CT to Norwalk, CT.  About 1/3 of the way to Norwalk, in Derby, I spotted two large, bright lights in the sky, and pointed them out to ((name deleted)).  The lights were larger than a visible planet would appear; the closest description I can give as to size was that they were similar in size to street lights viewed from a car, only they were clearly very high in the sky, so the actual size of the objects had to be enormous.  We watched the objects, which were hovering in place, the one on the left a little higher than the one on the right.  Suddenly, the objects moved, rotating around one another (top to bottom) to switch places with one another.  Then, the one which had moved to the top winked out, just vanished.  There was a faint trail leading upward where that one had been, but it disappeared quickly.  I drove another few exits to Shelton, CT, where we got off of the highway onto Bridgeport Avenue.  We stopped at a car dealership which had a clear view of that part of the sky (I&apos;d say, south, maybe south east part of the sky--I&apos;d have to look at a map to be more specific--we were driving generally south at the time).   We got out of the Jeep and stood in the lot, watching the remaining light.  It kept its position.  After a few minutes, we got back into the Jeep, and I continued to drive to Norwalk.  We watched the light all the way to Norwalk; it remained the in the same part of the sky the entire way (probably for a total of 20 miles or so), so it had to be pretty high up.  When I dropped ((name deleted)) off at her home, I had one more look at the object by a running track near her house, then I headed home (driving north, so I could no longer see it in front of me).  I couldn&apos;t see the part of the sky where it was when I got home, so I just went inside. The lights were pale yellow or white-ish in color.  I thought they seemed round, but ((name deleted)) said at the time (and has maintained) that they seemed triangular to her.  They were definitely not airplanes (we saw plenty of planes in the sky that night--no comparison).  They also didn&apos;t behave like planes.I&apos;m 29 years old, female, married, a webmaster/graphic designer by profession.  I&apos;ve never seen any unusual phenomena in the sky before, and have always been skeptical about the whole UFO thing.  While these lights may not be alien in nature, I certainly can&apos;t explain them (if you figure out what they were, please let me know!)

It suddenly slowed to a complete stop before going straight up and performing zig zag maneuvers. It then shot off in the NE direction.  Within 45 minutes we observed 2 fighter jets flying in tight wing formation going in the same direction as the UFO.The ufo appeared to be a slightly flattened egg shape. It was a clear cloudless day, with only con trails from the airplanes in the sky. Sunlight glinted off the top and the bottom.  The object was heading toward was the Malibu, CA area.  The area where we were observing is comprised of hills and agricultral zones.  Because of the cooler temperature, all planes in the sky were leaving con trails, however the ufo did not.  I am unable to estimate how high, or how big the object was, although it did not appear to be all that high, or all that large.  The hill directly beneath the object when it stopped had sheep grazing at the time.  The speed the object moved was amazing, as were the complicated maneuvers it performed.  Approximately 45 minutes later we observed 2 fighter jets flying in close tight wing formation and heading in the direction the ufo had taken.  One of the gentlemen with me if familar with planes and fighter jets as his father was a lifer in the Air Force, and!he spent nearly all of his growing up years on AF bases.  One other interesting point, the ufo was going in the direction of Rockadyne, a company facility that builds and tests rocket engines. That is all I can think of at the moment. I am a scheduler/ dispatcher for a technical service and support department.  My educational back ground is 2 years of college, and working in the Customer Service and Support field for 23 years.  I am interested in ufology, although I am not involved with any ufo groups.  There were 2 men beside myself who saw the ufo.

He was in a playful mood and I began to throw small stones which he would chase.  As I was walking over to pick up a few small stones in the corner of walled in yard, I happen to grance up into the very clear, cloudless sky and noticed a darken object very low to the ground.  At first I could not determine if the craft was moving.  At this point it was quite some distance away, approx 1 to 1 1/2 miles.  I continued to watch the craft and it began to get larger.  I knew the craft was obviously coming in my direction.  I kept wondering why the aircraft had not turned on its landing lights be cause the U.S. Air Force Base (Davis-Monthan AFB) was only a few miles south of my home.  The base is almost directly south of my home the the Tucson International Airport is just on the other side (slightly southwest).  I immediately called the craft to!my daughters attention who had just come out to tell me one of my favorate programs had just come on.  We both stood there watching as the craft got closer.  When it was approximately 3/4 mile from us,  it&apos;s true shape became visible.  It was a triangle shaped craft, moving very slowly at approximately five to eight miles per hour.  It was approximately 75 to 100 feet above the ground.  It had no lights on the front of the craft at all.  I told my daughter that it was going to pass almost directly over us.  When it got to only a few hundred feet away, we began to see lights on the bottom of it.  There were four lights that were in a straight line down the middle of it that ran the full lenght.  The lights were spaced about 20 feet apart.  As it passed slightly infront and above us, we could see very clearly that the craft was metalic in color and did not have a smooth surface but appeared to have a plated surface.  I could see what appeared to be lines of rivits that connecte!d them togather.  The craft did not make a single sound, and after spending 18 years on active duty in the Air Force, I knew it was not something that was man made.  It I were going to guess at its weight based on its size as mentioned above---I would say approxmiately 80 to 110 tons.  As I passed by my daughter was the first to notice two stobes on the rear corners that were blinking very fast (much faster than normal aircraft), both were white lights and could only be seen from behind.  Even when the craft was at its closest point from us, could not be seen until the rear of the craft began to become visable.  It was at this pont that I could even more clearly see the previously mentioned plating affect.  I was able to at this point based on the visible edges of the triangle in my own mind determine the thickness of the craft .  The back of the craft had three very large lights , two approximately 10 feet in diamenter and the third much larger light between them.  It was abo!ut 15 feet in diamenter.  It may sound strange but the lights were not giving off a really bright light but definately light that appeared to be defused.  The lights on the bottom of the craft appeared defused as well.  The craft was close enough that a man with a good strong throwing arm could have easily hit it.  I know that this story sounds like something out of a science fiction book, but I swear it&apos;s the truth.  I will be more than willing to take any lie-detector test you want.  Feel free to contact me concerning this sighting.  I almost forgot--the following day after the close encounter, while in the restroom of my home preparing to shower or something i remember finding a blister about the size of a dime just above my left ankle.  There was no pain, and I only noticed it as I was taking of my sock.  I pressed slightly on it and rolled my index finger around.  It poped and I expected to feel pain but there was none.  I pealed away the lose skin and noticed that the ti!ssue that should have appeared red or pink was brown.  Normally, blisters don;t leave scars in a perfect circle--this one did.  The only reason I have taken this time to tell you about what we seen, is that I can&apos;t stop thinking about it.  I hope if have really reached someone who will take the time necessary to confirm my sighting anyway they have to.  Now I know for sure--They do exist and I don&apos;t care who says they don&apos;t.

(visibility only distorted by minor upper- atmosphere turbulence)  I then noticed the object.  It caught my eye because of it&apos;s intense brightness.  I stared at it allowing myself to accuire a good sight of the object.  It possessed the likeness of a comet.  It was shaped as a &quot;tear-drop&quot;.  It turned out a tremendous light.  Even brighter than the moon on it&apos;s most radiant nights.  It&apos;s light was pure white with no distortion apparent.  There is a tall radio antenna with warning strobe lights situated on it; however, this is not at all what I witnessed.  The object, though described as a comet had none of a comet&apos;s properties; i.e.  A tail, haze behind the comet, small size and the other distinguishing features of a comet.

For an airplane to accelerate such as this thing did it and to dissapear from my field of view it would have to have an extrodinary engine, acceleration rate, and exaust hider (afterburner, it would be needed if this were even to be tried).

I saw what I tought to be a satellite or the space shutle slowly and steadily track across the sky from the south-east twards the north-west. I watched this object for a minute and than it stoped. I thought it was strage, but I sthat it might be a satellite that had moved itself into a geosynchronous orbit or possibly the space shutle that had done the same. Than it started to move strangely. It started to do little zig-zag patterns and move very slowly and rock back and forth. It also did a couple of 90 degree turns. I watched it for about 10 minutes, than I went and woke up my dad. He came and we watched it zig-zag and turn and start and stop and do spirals. The spirals seemed strange, to me, because it would start out with a big, slow circle and than the circle would began to tighten and it would speed up untill it had come to rest where it started.

I thought about the Stealth bomber, but wouldn&apos;t that at least make some sound? I could tell that this object was solid, as the middle of it darkened out the clear sky behind it. The lights seemed erie, not bright, but not dull, and they were steady, but also seemed to flicker. It took maybe two minutes for the craft to pass over me and as it began leaving my field of vision, I finally realized that I needed to follow it.

THE YEAR WAS ABOUT1970,  IT WAS IN THE FALL IN COLUMBUS OHIO. AT FIRST I THOUGH I SAW A BLIMP WITH LIGHTED ADVERTISING (THE KIND THAT IS COMPUTERIZED) OFF IN THE SKY BUT IT WAS TOO FAR AWAY TO SEE CLEARLY. A UFO WAS THE LAST THING ON MY MIND. BUT AS I STARED AT IT TO SEE WHAT IT WAS  ITSTARTED COMING DOWN TOWARD ME  FROM THE SKY AND HOVERED JUST IN FRONT OF ME  ABOUT 50 FEET ABOVE THE GROUND. IT WAS DEFINITELY A SAUCER SHAPE AND IT  WAS SILENT, IT WAS GOLD AND THE CENTER OF IT  LOOKED LIKE REVOLVING MIRRORED PANELS THAT NOW I WOULD SAY WERE SOLAR COLLECTORS BUT BACK THEN I HAD NO IDEAL WHAT SOLAR POWER WAS. IT WAS IN THE AFTERNOON ON A CLEAR DAY WITH THE SUN SHINING ON THE CRAFT FROM BEHIND ME SO I DEFINITELY SEEN IT IN THE BEST LIGHT POSSIBLE. IT JUST HOVERED THERE FOR A SHORT TIME ANDTHEN JUST FLEW UP AND AWAY FROM ME TO THE RIGHT  VERY FAST AND OUT OF SITE. AT THE TIME I WAS HEADED FOR A WOODED AREA WITH A BB GUN IN MY HANDS. I DO NOT KNOW IF THE GUN HAD ANYTHING TO DO WITH ITS INTEREST IN ME BUT I THINK IT MAY HAVE BEEN  THE REASON. IF I HAD NOT SEEN THIS I THINK THAT I WOULD NOT BELIEVE ANY OF THE UFO STORIES THAT WE HEAR OF. I FIND IT VERY HARD TO BELIEVE THAT ANY BEINGS FROM OUTER SPACE COULD TRAVEL SUCH A VAST DISTANCE BUT MAYBE IT&apos;S JUST BEYOND MY COMPREHENSION. SOMETIMES I THINK IT MUST HAVE BEEN A SECRET MILITARY AIR CRAFT OR TEST CRAFT BUT I SAW IT OVER 25 YEARS AGO AND HAVE NOT SEEN ANYTHING AT ALL LIKE IT SINCE. BELIEVE ME OR NOT THERE IS NO DOUBT IN MY MIND ABOUT WHAT ISAW. I CAN&apos;T EXPLAIN WHERE IT CAME FROM BUT I CAN TELL YOU WITH CONVICTION THAT FLYING SAUCERS DO EXIST. PLEASE POST THIS AND MY EMAIL ADDRESS. IF ANYONE HAS ANY QUESTIONS FOR ME ABOUT THIS SIGHTING  I WILL TRY TO ANSWER THEM.

He was driving his van east on Route 313 (?) in Bedminster Township, approximately 3 miles north of Doylestown, PA, when he observed three very bright objects, which he interpreted to be &quot;shooting stars.&quot;Approximately 2-3 minutes later, as he was descending a steep grade in the road, his lights and engine began to falter, then they quit altogether very abruptly.  Also, the van stopped very suddenly, although he noted that he was not thrown forward when it stopped, which he thought was unusual.  Then he felt &quot;something move through the truck,&quot; and when he attempted to turn the ignition key to restart the van&apos;s engine, he could not move, either his hand, or any other part of his body.  It was at this point that he felt that something was in the van with him, which was &quot;reading his thoughts.&quot;  He later added that it felt that there was something &quot;right inside his brain.&quot;  This part of the experience lasted, he thought, &quot;only a second.&quot;Suddenly, he noted that the engine in his van was running again, even though he had not tried to restart the engine.  It just started of its own accord. He added that it had been very windy that night, but when the object was above him, there was a sudden &quot;whoosh&quot; of air, and it was gone.

Was riding around with a sheriff (you cannot use this) from the next county five years ago and asked if they ever has UFO sightings.  He said there were some in the 70&apos;s and a couple of officers reported them.  They were flown down to Washington. And when they  came back they reported NOTHING.  My ex partner who worked for a time in West Ellicott, NY, went up to a golf course after reports and found a scorched part.

The weather was clear and the windwas minimal.  This Isl. is about 90 miles so.of N.Y. City, there at least two military basesrelatively close by.  There was 5 0r 6 of us sittingclose to the waterline at Beach Haven Terrace beach.  As this is a summer recreation areaand I was 19 years old at the time we were partying at the time of the sighting.  At thetime of the viewing I was not out of control perhaps slightly high but nowhere near to the point of halucinating (sorry about the spelling). I was facing the Ocean and I was just taking in the veiw, for example I noticed some boats and ships out for an evening cruise and that the Moon illuminated the sky enoughto see the eastern horizen very clearly. At thispoint out of my left eye I saw a very bright light parallel with the horizen, using my thumb at arms length I would estimate it at 1 or 2 degrees above the clearly seen horizen. Afterabout a second or two I shouted out to the othersto look over there. All but one of us saw it(the guy with his back to the sea was&apos;nt quickenough). by the time everyone looked it startedto do a 90 degree turn over the horizen and it did not appear to slow down, the fireball&apos;slight faded over the horizen within a secondor two.  And thinking back on the moment (later on that night whenI was tring to get to sleep) I believe I saw the siloutte of a cigar shape craft in frontos the fireball. This I can not be absolutly sure since my eyes did not have enough time to focus in on any details of what ever it was.I am also aware of the fact that it seemed to be reacting to my excitementfor the 90 deg. turn accured directly striaghtout from our position, a coincidence maybe, butI wonder.  I hope you can coralate this report with someoneelse who witnessed this event,I sure some of thefolkes on board some of those ships got an evenbetter look at it since they were much closer.I&apos;m just guessing but I believe it traveled atleast 2 or so in the time it was flying strightThe fireball did not get much bigger whenit was straight out from our position on the beachwhich is as close to sea level as one can get.With the help of a math oriented person you could get a rough ideaof how far it traveled and approx. speed.By the way I realize that CLOSE ENCOUNTERS OFTHE THIRD KIND had just come out in 77 and I really did want to see a UFO but at that timein my life I just had a passing interest inthe subject.

We both witnessed the event for its duration and had both worked as National Park Rangers prior to this sighting.  I havn&apos;t reported this officially until now because I thought we were probably the only ones to see such a thing, and that few would believe us.  Recent news reports of sightings in that exact area promted me to write this in the case it could be helpful.  My fiance and I split up not too long after this event and havn&apos;t spoken since.  She could be contacted for independent verification, if someone wanted to do so.  She was really frightened by what happened and hence missed some of what I saw, but I think she saw the majority of what I am about to report.  The incidident:  I drove out cross-country to my favorite area in my 4Runner and parked it facing East, about 100 ya!rds from the edge of a long, low mesa extending North and South.  The landscape dropped off to the East towards the Little Colorado River and the Navajo Res.  We built a campfire near my lowered tailgate and began to enjoy the evening.  At one point, I was sitting on the tailgate facing West while my fiance was tending the fire.  I looked straight up at the sky, and in my peripheral vision caught sight of a blinking light.  At first, I just thought it was an airplane, but I noticed it wasn&apos;t moving at all.  Then, I noticed from 5-7 other blinking lights in the same general quadrant of the sky--and outstretched hand would probably &quot;capture&quot; the space they all occupied.  I think they were whitish blue, but they may have been light red (I&apos;m sorry, I really can&apos;t recall exactly) and were not blinking in unison.  None were moveing at all.  This is why I kept watching them and told my fiance to look at them.  Then, we saw a lazer-like pulse of light shoot from one to another.  I thi!nk I saw this happen 2, maybe 3 times.  Then we noticed a whitish yellow light--much like a distant headlight--travelling near the ground in the distance ahead (East) of us.  At first I thought it was a car or motorcyle--but I&apos;ve never seen any other person out as far as I went, and certainly never at night... About the time I was beginning to worry that it was someone travelling toward I light, it went up and then back down a few degrees offf the horizen.  It continued to repeat this as it travellied along.  Most of the terrain there is fairly level, so I started doubting it was a car.  I put out the fire and had my fieance turn off her headlamp (she was too scared to do so).  When I looked back at the whitish light, it was apparently moving in our direction--but I couldn&apos;t tell how far away it was...at one point I thought for certain it was only 50 yards in front of us.  But there was no sound at all, so I figured I must be wrong.  Then we looked back up to the sky to see if!the other lights were still there; they were.  But when we looked out to the East for the whitish light, it was gone.  Then I noticed the same bluish or reddish (I think blue) lights blinking in the NW sky!  They had moved from the SE to the NW.  And then, to the N, we saw the whitish light travelling along the ground again...going up and down periodically like no car or earthbound vehicle could have done.  I t was almost as if it was searching for something.  Then it disappeared and the lights in the NW sky were gone too.  We slept in the back of my truck and had a restless night&apos;s sleep.  It was the strangest thing I had ever seen (though we both did sight one UFO each when much younger).  I always wondered if the military was conducting some advanced lazer weaponry by sattelites--but this never does quite explain the white object hovering near the ground.....The next day, oberservations of the terrain in the directions we saw the white light made it even more clear that it!could not have been a vehicle.  Background information:  I was 33 at the time, and my fiance 29.  We both have bachelors degrees and some other training.  We were very healthy and didn&apos;t do any drugs or drink alcohol, etc.  We had each worked as National Park Rangers, and I was/am more of a skeptic than anything else.  I used to love to read the Skeptical Inquirerer!  Now I am more open to various possibilities, but I still thing it could have been some type of military operation.  I sure would like to know!

We were hoping to see a clear night so we could later come back and photograph the comet.We drove out to the airport farthest from town. The road going in is dirt, and scary, but he grew up here, where I am from the east coast of the states. To me, it was extremely dark out, even with the clear sky.When we arrived at the final part of the road into the airport, we were facing an south easterly direction. In front of us in the sky, were some objects flying from east to west, as best I could tell.I asked my husband to stop, and we got out and watched them fly just under mars and disappear. Later I discovered he had seen two objects closer to the horizon, flying west to east, and flying in a closer formation than what I saw. They were orange in color, and round in shape, but also very far away.They were also flying to fast to be the usual satellite, and too high up to be a plane.I&apos;d seen a light like that last year while looking up at the comet of 1996, while at a pit stop, so I didn&apos;t think much of it.There is a light at the actual airport that didn&apos;t give us very good viewing of the comet, so we drove back onto the road where we could see. We looked around, and decided to go back home for the camera as picture taking would be excellent, and saw a car comingtowards us. He started up the car, and we took off to home, when out of my window, facing mars, I saw the light returning from the west...just one. I asked him to stop again, I see it I said. As soon as I said it, the object turned straight towards usand I started to scream to him, oh my God, it&apos;s coming at us! They&apos;re coming for us! I was so scared, and it seemed to fly from a high altitude to a lower one, at which point I began to get very afraid, and I started to yell at it to go away, that we didn&apos;t want it here, and it couldn&apos;t take us.By the time he had stopped and turned off the car, the object was already speeding away up into the sky, and as he jumped out of the car, I saw the last of it disappear.It happened so quickly, and I was so afraid that we went home to calm down a bit....he still wanted a picture of the comet, and I wasn&apos;t about to stay home alone, so I went with him, and we saw nothing, probably because we were prepared with a camera this time!Just this past weekend, a friend of ours said they saw something similiar flying over Hinton, around three am, when he was driving back from Edmonton.I also note that an earthquake, unusual for this area, happened the morning before our sighting, and was a 4.2 (?) located just southeast of Jasper. I reported this to a an association up here called AUFORA, but I haven&apos;t heard anything from them. We also checked the flight log at the airport when we went back, andthere was no flight recorded, although there was a plane landed from out of town, and a few unoccupied cars.My husband and I are 30 and 24 repectively, and lead fairly normal lives.

My brothers attention was drawn away bywhat he believed to be a shooting star.He pointed at it but i was unable to locate it due to partial cloud cover, and its dimmness. He lost sight of it in the clouds, but regained sightof it comming out from the other side of the cloud. At that point he noted that the object made a course change of about 20 degrees and continuedout of sight over the horizon. The object followed an almost perfect north to south course untill the change which was slightly more to the east.I was unable to see this object as it was moving so fast it was gone in less than 10 seconds. There was no &apos;tail&apos; on the object, nor was theremore than one single point of light. its dimmness was equivilent to that of a satellite reflecting the sun in the evening and reflecting the suns light.After he settled down, and finished explaining his idea about it being a UFO, we went back to fishing, both of us now watching the sky.  Less than5 minutes later, the object reappeared, again from the north. this time I was the one who spotted it first and pointed it out to my brother. He confirmedthat it was the same object he viewed previously. With both of us watching, the object started a series of right angle turns that seemed to defy the laws of physics.It made about 6 or 7 course changes overhead and continued towards the south like origionally, and disappeared behind our bay house. It AGAIN reappeared out fromthe side of the bay house low on the horizon to the south over the gulf of mexico. at this point it was moving horizonally and was moving extremely fast the entire way.By extremely fast I mean like a shooting star moves fast. We both watched it move horizontally about 30-40 degrees across the horizon, then it turned again, in a very sharpzero curve turn to a northerly direction. It proceeded across the sky making one final course change of about 10-20 degrees comming to an almost perfect north direction andproceeded out of sight into the clouds along the north horizon.I need to note here that it is uncanny how familiar it is to the looks of a satellite in orbit. We both had the perception that the object was VERY far away. With the exceptionof a few low clouds, it was VERY dark and MANY stars were visible. I think city lights (like from Houston 60 miles away) would easily have drowned out the light.its my personal view that the object was not in our atmosphere.Also, i emphasize that every single turn it made had no &apos;curves&apos; in them. If you drew a right angle, thats the path it was following.I would have been more skepticle of what we saw, but increadibly, there was a report the following monday (we saw it on the first saturday morning following memorial day)in the Houston Chronicle (June 2nd i believe) reporting that there were 16 reported sightings of a UFO from Galveston Island.

We passed through Kingman, Az and a little later, around 10 pm, I noticed a light moving to our right. I brought it to my friends attention and we watched a single object come out of the east, travelling west over the ridge of a small mountain. There was only one object. It was small and luminous, but not very bright. It looked about three times the size of a regular star. I would have considered it to be a conventional aircraft, had it not been for the way it moved.

Parked on a pullout near the top of the ridgetop. Saw red-green halo light moving across opposite ridgetop where no road existed.  Traversed ridge at medium speed then stopped, shot up to higher altitude, performed some unusual aerial manuevers before parking in the sky to the SE. It was soon joined by another identical light which also became stationary.  A large, flat, silent dark perfect triangular craft came down between the two lights and proceeded directly by them up the valley. It flew below the top of the ridge and was clearly visible for 30 seconds to a minute before it passed out of sight. The two lights remained where they were and were visible even after daylight.&quot;Dunn sighting&quot; two. The brothers were hunting near Highland Springs and were again sitting in their truck parked in a pullout near the ridgetop facing east, looking out over the valley between them and the opposite ridge.  It was approximately 1/2 to 3/4 mile across. Suddenly a light appeared to the NE over the opposite ridge.  They both thought it was a vehicle at first but having hunted the ridge they knew there was no road there only brush.  At brushtop height and as large as a truck the light progressed along the ridge.  Viewing it with a 20power spotting scope they describe it as a redish-green pulsing light with a clear white light in the middle.they didn&apos;t know what it was but were able to follow it in the scope,(on a tripod), until it reached the end of the ridge to the SE. There it &apos;jumped&apos; back and forth in the sky for a number of minutes. They were unable to keep it in the viewfinder during these &apos;jumps&apos;.  It then became stationary in the sky.  After a while, from the SE and much further away, a second identical light appeared and flew toward the first one, joining it slightly further to the west but also stationary.  The two lights never moved again.  About 04:30 a large flat, dark and perfectly triangular craft came from between the two lights.  At first they thought it was a plane but it came directly down the canyon they were looking out over, from SE to NW, and lower than the opposite ridge.  It flew at a steady crusing speed and made no sound except for the sound of air being pushed, like a hissing breeze. There was a slight haloed gaseous effect coming from the craft that made it difficult to observe with !the scope but didn&apos;t affect the nnaked eye.  A single spotting clear light shone out ahead from the middle underside of the craft.  What appeared to be windows also were apparent.  They both felt that if they could see it, it could see them and they felt like sitting ducks!  However they were not as frightened as the first time they witnessed a sighting. The way it cruised by reminded them of tourists driving through town.  They estimated it at approximately 25 yards wide.  As it passed two red lights, like taillights shone out from the back of the craft.  They waited for the noise but none came.  They stayed at the spot until dawn, viewing the two original bright lights.  These lights remained in exactly the same location and were so bright they could still be observed after daylight.  They finally got tired of watching and drove home.  Two interesting questions are posed by their two sightings in different wilderness locations.  Either they are simply fortunate to have been !in the direct paths, away from civilization, of these vehicles and their sightings are mere coincidences, or the crafts flew by them purposely.  In both cass they were entirely visible to any vehicle at a higher altitude from great distances away.  Also it seems outlandishly coincidental that they just happened on the particular routes of these crafts, when miles of alternative wilderness areas exist. It may also indicate a similar flight pattern of wilderness routing though it seems odd that if this routing exists to decrease sightings, no attempt was made to hide themselves from these two entirely visible observers.  The Dunn&apos;s are totally reputable men, from midland farm families, as down to earth as you can get!  They never even considered the possibility of what they witnessed until it was before them.  they still exhibit some fear as to the identity and purpose of the crafts and have not discussed or reported the events publicly. But they are now watching continually.  D!unn sighting one contains the report of their first sighting as well as their most recent land -based phenomena sighting.  They are taking me to the sights soon. I&apos;m looking forward to it!    wolf", "object_type": "", "airport_dist": "", "no_of_movies": "1", "airport_name": "", "user_rating": "61018", "shape": "light", "meteor_fall_probability": "0.010652726", "ngrams_rate": "0.000017", "location": "Lakeport (near), CA", "imdb_score": "5.8", "duration": "5 hours", "sighted_at": "19951101", "id": "1fe8507d-bc46-48a3-b10d-245dd26067e7", "meteor_probability": "0.012320329", "phenomenon": "alien_abduction"}, {"jaccard_score": 0.003426124197002141, "image_captions": "", "phenomenon": "alien_abduction", "location": "Provo/Orem/Salt Lake City, UT", "reported_at": "19970512", "per_capita_alcohol": "0", "object_type": "", "airport_dist": "", "airport_name": "", "no_of_movies": "4", "user_rating": "403014", "shape": "light", "meteor_fall_probability": "0.037098609", "ngrams_rate": "0.0000193", "imdb_score": "7.7", "duration": "2 mins", "education_rate": "", "sighted_at": "19970510", "id": "ecbeac7f-95be-4f9e-b398-fb0cb3c3c0d0", "meteor_probability": "0.001768868", "description": "Summary : Saw a white yellowish light performing vertical and horizontial maneouvers in the northern sky.  At one point it elongated itself and moved one point to another almost instantaneously.At 00:25 am on May 10, 1997, I was getting into bed and glanced out my bedroom window and noticed a large white &apos;star&apos; with a yellowish hue to it with a background of the black sky and other stars.   I remarked that I have never seen such a large &apos;star&apos; before.  It didn&apos;t twinkle as the other stars did, which make me even more curious.  Its shape wasn&apos;t circular, but rather more a square with concaved side.  (Discription of star shape:  Place a square on one its corners, and its axises both vertical and horizontial, take the circumferencial straight lines and cause them to become concaved towards the center-point where the axises of square meet. )  This was the shape of the &apos;star&apos;.After looking at the star for about ten seconds, it disappeard.  It reappeard several seconds later to the left of its original position.  The color had changed from the yellowish white to blueish white.  The size had also changed, it resembled more like a regular star size.  Intermittenly the blueish light would flash, although not at regular intervals.  Occasionally (two or three times), a small red light flashed (but not as frequently as the &apos;white&apos; light) This red light was also irregular in its flashing.  No blue light was ever seen as in regular aircraft lights.The light moved from its &apos;9 o&apos;clock&apos; position to the &apos;center of the clock&apos; position&apos; and immediately perform a 90 degree turn to the &apos;12 o&apos;clock&apos; position. in a fraction of a second.  There was no gradient climb from the &apos;9 o&apos;clock&apos; to the &apos;12 o&apos;clock&apos; positions, even in the other movements mentioned below.It remained for several seconds in the &apos;12&apos; position, and performed a vertical descent to the &apos;6 o&apos;clock&apos; position.  (No red light flashing)The light continued this movement between the above four points, but never, while I viewed it, move to the &apos;3 o&apos;clock&apos; position.At one point in its movements, from the &apos;9&apos; to the &apos;center&apos; positions, the object seemed to elongate itself and be at both positions at the same time for only a fraction of a second, and then repositioned itself  from the &apos;9&apos; to the &apos;center&apos; positions.I decided to get my video camera, and after a quick search of two rooms, found it and returned to the bedroom, but unfortunaltely the light was gone, so I did not get it on video.Total time was about a 1 minute to a minute and a half."}, {"jaccard_score": 0.003426124197002141, "image_captions": "", "description": "A man called to report his sighting of a UFO over the ocean, &quot;15 miles, or so,&quot; with red flashing lights.

The 2pm (PDT) sky was partly cloudy, mostly evenly scattered cumulus with a clear blue sky behind them. I am sometimes given to looking straight up into the sky in search of high-flying raptors or other soaring birds. As I looked directly overhead,I noticed something moving well above the cumulus clouds. It was a silvery object about the size of a dime held at arm&apos;s length moving in an unwavering straight line from west to east. I watched as it passed behind the clouds which were moving so slowly as to appear to be completely still. I would not want to hazard a guess as to its altitude or airspeed. My first thought was that it was simply a weather balloon. (In fact, I&apos;m still leaning towards that explanation.) As I studied it I wondered if it was in fact not silver, but translucent. It had a bluish cast but was darker around a well-defined edge and had no irregularities in its shape or surface. However, a few things didn&apos;t rest well with me. I&apos;ve seen weather balloons in flight before and this wasn&apos;t like either of them. This was perfectly round and had no visible payload. The others I had seen weren&apos;t nearly so symmetrical and were visibly balloons with something suspended underneath. Also, given that this object was well above the clouds, it would have been a *very* large balloon. As far as I know, there aren&apos;t any launch sites west of Portland used for such launchings. (That may just be my ignorance in this instance; the only launch site for high- altitude balloons that I know of is near Palestine, Texas.) I found it odd that it moved so much faster than the lower clouds, though of course the possibility of the jet stream comes to mind. I was also impressed that it moved in such a straight line. It covered about 30 degrees of the sky in 4-5 seconds. It disappeared behind a solid line of clouds banked up against Mt. Hood and the Oregon Cascades to the east. I have no idea if this was a *real* UFO or not. In fact, the most remarkable aspect of this incindent may simply be that I saw an ordinary thing in a place most people wouldn&apos;t ordinarily look--straight overhead--without some other motivation. It just to be odd enought to warrant reporting to you. Had I known how to contact anyone regarding this prior, I would have.

I noticed its approach and then realized that it had a unusual, triangular-shaped aircraft flying close and to the left of its tail.  This craft? was about 1/4 the size of the UAL plane, triangular-shaped, flat, light grey color. Why?On Feb. 17, I was returned from Chicago on a United Airlines flight to Ontario, CA at about 10AM in the morning. We were flying at about 32,000 feet and the weather conditions were very clear.  Approaching us from the south going north and a bit easterly, I noticed another aircraft flying beneath us.  I am no expert, but I could identify the aircraft as a UAL aircraft. What originally got my attention was that it didn&apos;t seem too far beneath our flight and it seemed so clear because of the lack of clouds, dust, etc.  Then, I noticed that something (another craft?) was tagging along with it, rather close and off the left side of the UAL&apos;s tail.  When I looked closer, I couldn&apos;t figure out what it was or why it was following so closely.  I am not sure of the model of the UAL aircraft, but the &quot;unknown&quot; flying with it was about a quarter of the UAL&apos;s size, triangular shaped, point forward (but the forward point was slightly rounded toward the tip).  Its color was a flat, light g!rey - not shiny as a usual, unpainted aircraft would be.  It was as though the two crafts were flying in formation - that close.I keep them plain in sight until they had passed completely beneath our flight.There is probably a logical explanation for this, but it seemed very strange to me and when I review the sight in my mind, it still seems strange.   Others on the plane may have noted it, but no one else mentioned it.  I was sitting in a row next to a window, just forward of the leading edge of the aircraft, by myself.  My husband picked me up at the airport in Ontario and I mentioned it to him right away.  He guessed maybe it was some kind of target or balloon, but it did have some depth to it, yet nothing on top that I could see which might be like a raised cockpit area, nor did it have any tail(s) or projections, nor any indentation on the back edge like I have seen on some experimental aircraft.  Strange color, too, not too noticeable in the distance and if it had not been so clear, it might have disappeared into the desert sands and dust.

One physician Dr. Oestriche (now deceased) saw lights back in the field and found circular depressions when he investigated the next day. Krueggers, who still live there have mentioned seeing things also. It was so common and widespread knowledge, that people used to park up and do!wn Bray Rd. to ufo watch.

It glides by quickly and silently, then disappearsMy husband and I had just finished dinner at the restaurant at our Honeymoon Resort when we decided to walk along the beach back to our rooms. Most of the resort guests were at a barbeque on the nearby (50 yards away) island called Kokomo, so the resort was fairly quiet and we were alone, except for maybe an employee now and then. We decided to stop and enjoy the stars. We were both silently enjoying the view when I noticed a huge black object. ( I cannot however, determine how far away it was) it cast a slight reflection on the underneath side of it, as if the moon were glowing on it. The only way to describe the shape is to say it looked like a large stingray without a tail sailing through the sky. It did not make a sound, and it lasted only seconds. I could not figure out what I had seen, I hesitated, and then asked my husband if he had seen it too. He said yes, and said he was glad I had seen it because he though it was his imagination. We tried to explain it to ourselve!s, but the only thing we could come up with was that maybe it was a large black bird gliding over the water. But the only birds we had ever seen near the bay were totally white. The bird would have also had to have been within 5 feet in front of us to appear so large. We would have seen the bird clearly because the resort had small lamps that lit the nearby walkways, and we were able to view a gazebo that stretched out in front of us about 25 feet away. We tried unsuccessfully to see the object again, and finally gave up after about 15 minutes. I don&apos;t really recall the exact moment of the sighting, because it happened over a year ago, but we did immediately tell our family about in when we returned home.

Only  a white blinking light remained after window lights were shut off.  Light appeared to be center top.  Also, no sound and other witnesses did not seem to be too concerned that they did not what this object was.  The wife and I know!Background will mildly rolling with numerous houses and apartments visable.  Object was at time below the horizon in a slight valley just to the west of the Bel-ford theater on IL RT 20 which runs between Rockford and Belvidere.  This object was extremely large and seemed massive-heavy but suspended in the air and wobbling slowly like when you spin a frisbee on a string. spin it slowly and then strike one side.  At the time I told Hynek&apos;s secretary that I thought that the windows measured about 20&apos; x 70&quot;. 20 wide - 70 high.  In retrospect, I underestimated these dimensions.  Probably more like 50 by 300.  At that time John Anderson from Rockford was running for president.  Haven&apos;t heard much about him lately. He lost as a third party candidate.  I am 49 years old now but it is still vivid in our memories.  Most people look us strangely when we mention it.  Neither of us have seen anything similar since.  We also called the Rockford Airport the next day and they said they had seen nothing unusual on rader the night before.  They said it was probably an advertising plane pulling a lighted banner.  Yea, right!  I have never seen an ad plane that makes no sound, flying around at midnight with a lighted sign the size of Commisky Park.  I just gave up trying to convince peiople.  I guess it doesn&apos;t really matter anyway.

But airtraffic controllers and basepersonnel noticed nothingunusual, Capt.

Theywould have needed sunglasses!&quot;Charlie Goodyear checked withlocal police and sheriff&apos;sdept. and found there were noreportings of the anamoly. Ichecked with the local firemarshall whom is in charge of,and lives in, the range landswhere the incident occured.  Hestated he was not aware of theoccurance or anyone reportingit, but would call me if heheard anything.According to the witness&apos;sdescriptions, this light didnot move across the sky and didnot seem to originate from aphysical object, but simplyexisted as its own source withno density. No noise could beheard and it did not travel ormove from its active location.It would however, shift andtransform from being round(size of dime), then enlargingto round (silver dollar), thenwould stretch out &quot;like gum&quot; inlength (dollar bill), thenseparating into two. Then itwould come back together like around dime and would then fadeout to size of a pinpoint, likea TV tuner turned off. Then itwould come back repeating theprocess. Witnesses stated thisprocess repeated about 6 times.One time upon separation, thetwo lights  moved diagonally toeach other, like a &quot;chevron&quot;with 2 strips, shimmering likea reflection on water.Eventually when fadeing itnever came back. While cloudswere scattered through the skysthe area where the lights wereshowing contained none. Tomstated he frequents through thearea quite often and is awareof regular air traffic due tothe AFB, however during thislight show no air traffic wasnoticed what so ever.The witnesses were interviewedtogether by phone.  Tom is 52,and is a grocer&apos;s clerk.  Maryis 50 and is a purchaser for anintercom company.  Both areinterested in spiritual/psychictype information, but do notkeep up with latest gossip orhappenings in that regard.Mary stated she did not read orwatch the news reports, andthat as she did not even knowabout the comet, until sheasked Tom one night what shewas seeing in the sky. Bothhave had a light interest inUFO&apos;s but again do not keep upwith latest gossip etc...Together through the interview,they seemed to mutually agreeupon their story, as theyshared enthusiasm andexcitement about it.  Neitherwould speculate as to what itwas they saw, except that theyboth &apos;felt&apos; it was not aterrestial source orphenomenon. Both did not feelfrightened by the expierienceand talked about it as apositive expierience. Therewere no physical effectsreported.  Witnesses reportedaprox. 5 vehicles passed onHighway 12 during theirstationary 5 miniute viewing.They found it strange that thevehicles passed as withoutnotice of the event. As ifobservation was limited only tothose who were there initially.The area in which this occuredis a rural area, consisting ofplains type terrain, coveringover 2000 sq miles.  Populationwithin the sighting area issparse, probably 1 ranch forevery 2 sq miles. Communitiesclose enough to have possiblywitnessed the light show wereBirdslanding, Rio Vista, Dixon,and possibly eastern Fairfieldand Suisun.  All aresurrounding the proximitywithin 15 miles.  Birdslandingis the closest within 5 miles.Attempts were made to locateaddtional witnesses with nosuccess. Contact was madeeither in person or by leavinga note, with ranches in theimmediate vicinity of thesighting location.Birdslanding, a rural communityof ranches, is directly acrossHighway 12,  may containwitnesses.  Many events of thisnature, in the past, have beenreported in the Birdslandingarea.  I made contact with thepostmaster for this area andgave her cards with a requestfor contact if she heardanything.  She readily agreed.I went out to view the site andcheck for any natural sourceswhich may explain this event. Idid so on 4/21 at 23:00 to gainperspective with a similarnight environment.

Whileconsidering this as a possiblesource it was eliminated whilereinacting their viewpoint.The towers were to far off inan easterly direction and theirproximity to the horizon couldnever have contributed to thesize and altitude of the event.Additionaly the descriptionwhich was given did not matchthe constant sequence in whichthese towers flashed.Daytime observation of the areawas also made.

My first thought, Helicopter, but no sound was heard, from anything, when I think about it.approx (3) white smaller lights traveling with it.

This is gut feeling purely.First, this is all in retrospect, accuacy would require meeting with ex-girlfriend due to my lack of memory regarding anything prior to that sight.Sholl Canyon Park, top of Glenoaks Blvd, in Glendale, CA. A park is there where we would go to spend time  together, ie, the view..a couple thing. I recall being in the middle of the street with her, walking uphill, it seems we both recognized it at the same time.  Three points of lights (all red) forming a triangle shape.  We were walking up hill maybe eastbound  facing the mountains, Mt Wilson to be more accurate.  What got our attention was my saying, &quot;shsss, I can&apos;t hear anything&quot;  Approx; (3) other white lights were in it&apos;s immediate vacinity. I say approx, because the Burbank Glendale skies are always lit up considering the Burbanks airport. My closest comparison would be this description. I though maybe it was three different helicopters flying in a triangle formation.  Being that the lights were lower that the top of Mt wilson, that tells me it was very close ( a few miles if that) Only no blinking lights that usually gives us a human identification. I don&apos;t know if yo!u could see through the center   because it was the same color as the backround mountains, which is black. Anyway we both stood like dazed children, lost in the middle of the street. And watched it move slowly north untill it looked like it vanish behind Burbanks city lights. not once did we here anything we could associate with what we know is in our skies.  And for some reason I dismissed it and labled it three helicopters., because if it wasn&apos;t three different light sources generating that triangular or greater than sign &quot; &lt; &quot;  tilt that about 90 degrees, so that the bottom light is where the rear propeller would be a single craft. If it wasn&apos;t 3 choppers, then it was truly massive in my eyes. No sound what so ever, no wind no traffic, no nothing but us talking and saying &quot;look at that!&quot; &quot;what is that&quot;? &quot;shhh, let me listen&quot; In retrospect, I wonder, is it a valid possibility, ...ok, hear it go..that we were looking at something that dropped us off?..I&apos;m not mental or at lea!st no ones labled me that, yet.

I am still bewildered. I was at a friend&apos;s place discussing a future project. About 10:20 PM I left the building to go back home. I got out of the side door and walked across the parking lot. The sky tonight is fairly clear, except a few clouds here and there. Suddenly on top of the clouds I saw what I first thought a cloud moving faily quick towards the North. As it passed the small group of clouds it was actually a group of five circles in some V formation, with 4 of the cricles on the right side, and one on the left. They were, and I noticed, evenly spaced. The color was some sort of light gray, paler than the clouds. I look down then up and it was still there, moving at a nonchalant speed direction North. Wow! Whatever it was it faded in the sky as it moved away (not because it disappeared, but because of the distance). I ran back to  my friend Mike&apos;s place and tried to reach him but the intercom was dead (usual). I ran under is porch and yell! ed his name. He and his girlfriend ran down to see what was happening.

Don&apos;t take me wrong, I am not a hardcore disbeliever, but I tend to believe that everything can be explained (especially UFO cases) but this one is a little tougher. It was not a reflection on the clouds, it was on top of them (they were really sparse too). It was not an airplane, it was too high. I called places to find out what the ceiling was but I could not find a place that would report that. I got on the web trying to find something and I got here by curiosity. It was not balloons, it travelled to fast (when I say it, I mean the formation). The formation was going at the same speed throughout the experience. I don&apos;t know what it was!

Sighting of a UFO which appeared to land,  a UFO chasing the car some 50m behind, and the sighting of a man which was extremely unusual looking.The first event to happen was the sighting of a &apos;roadwork&apos; man sweeping the highway.  Whilst driving along the highway, an extremely bright light suddenly appeared in front of us. At first we thought it was a truck coming towards us - common on the highway-but as we drove towards it we realised it was a stationary truck with a bright light attatched to the front of the grill. Upon getting closer to the light, it was that bright and blinding that we had to slow down to 10kms just to see the road and where we were going. Half the road was closed and suddenly we were able to see a man. There he was sweeping the road at 21:30(approx) 200kms from the nearest roadhouse. We slowly drove up to him to explain that we could not see the road due to the light and essentialy could not see him. We now believe that not being able to see him was what he wanted. The man hardly showed his face and what we did see - he had an extremely high forehead and very wide set eyes. He was approx. 7 fee!t tall and of stocky build. He did not want us talking to him and made every attempt to get us to move on quickly. As we drove off the light slowly disappeared - which is what got us thinking. Due to the cloud cover that night, a light of that intensity would have cast quite a bit of glare i.e. we would have seen the light from quite a distance, however the light suddenly flashed on and we were not descending or ascending a hill! My questions at the time were who was he, what was he doing that far out of town at that time of night and what was he sweeping off the road?Eventually that passed as we drove along the highway again.Approximately 30mins after this happened an extremely bright light came up from behind us - we had not passed a car since the roadwork man - to within 50m of us. It followed  our car for about 4 seconds before disappearing. The lights intensity was similar to that of a cars high-beam headlights and was orange-yellow in colour. Neither of us said anything - we were starting to get spooked.As we were driving up the road we were heading into a storm. As we got closer to the storm I was checking the stars to see where the storm cloud started - it was that black that there was a definite black line where the storm cloud startes. As I was watching the stars I noticed an extremely orange star. As I continued watching it moved forward so it kept up with the car, not falling behind like the other stars were. From where we were this &apos;star&apos; was about 5-6mm across. As I continued watching the light moved on a diagonal path towards the horizon and was now in front of the car. This light continued downwards until it reached a point slightly above the horizon, if not on the horizon, and that is where it stayed until the blackness of the strom blocked my view.Among these happenings we passed a military style vehicle with no insignia which was cruising up the highway rather slowly. We could not see the driver as we passed the vehicle.The storm that we drove through was extremely active for about 2 hours until we actually reached it. (there had been continuous lightning for these two hours). Yet as soon as the light was blocked out by the clouds all lightning stopped. As far as we know a storm does not just stop suddenly.As we neared Coober Pedy, a white 4WD suddenly pulled out from the side of the road and forced our car to slow down considerably. In the back window of this car two shapes could be seen moving and I can tell you with all honesty that they did not look like dogs or humans or any other animal but I did not get a very good look at them so I cannot accurately say or judge what they were.We eventually made it to Coober Pedy and were relieved to see other humans.The whole event really spooked both me and my fiance and we have vowed never to travel on the highway agein at night. (the highway runs directly from Adelaide to Alice Springs and continues to Darwin, passing through townships and roadhouses.It passes through some of the most lonely land in Australia).As we checked out of our motel the next morning we metioned these events to the receptionist who just smiled and said oh well you wouldn&apos;t be the first to talk about things like that. That was all we could get out of her,she wouldn&apos;t talk anymore.For my fiance, it is the second time that he has witnessed events of a &apos;supernatural&apos; kind - he is in his late twenties. I have witnessed other happenings including metallic cigar shaped objects and other orange lights resembling stars but moving otherwise to indicate that they were not a star.

Light shown on ground, briefly.While coming home from working the 4-12 shift as a Police Officer, I noticed an &quot;airplane&quot; flying in the direction in which I was traveling.  After driving a few miles, I noticed that the &quot;airplane&quot; was still on it&apos;s course. It should have been far away by that time. I was curious, but soon forgot about it. As I was turning onto the final rode that leads to my housing plan, I noticed that the &quot;airplane&quot; was still there.The PLan where I lived was on the highest point in the area and as I got to the Plan, my visibility was practically unlimited except for some trees.  I could see the &quot;airplane&quot;better at this point and I suspected that it was a helicopter because of the slow speed.  The &quot;helicopter&quot; displayed a search type light at the ground and I thought it was a medical helicopter looking for a landing zone.  I&apos;ve seen helicopters do this in my capacity as a Police Officer, and I was worried that someone might have been badly injured in my neighborhood. While thinking these thoughts, the &quot;helicopter&quot; turned off the search light and continued in a straight line heading directly toward my housing plan.I hurried my vehicle to a point where I figured the &quot;helicopter&quot; would pass over, and I turned off my head lights. Then I shut off my engine and got out of the vehicle to get a better look at the &quot;helicopter&quot;. When I got out of the vehicle and looked up in the sky, I noticed that I was not looking at a helicopter, airplane, blimp or anything I could recognize.  I was looking at a triagular shaped craft with a light at each point, smaller lights were dotted underneath as this was my point of reference, and no strobe lights like a commercial aircraft would have.  The object made no sound, although it seemed to me that I could hear wind rushing past. Faintly, albeit.  The altitude was very low, a few hundred feet or less, and the speed was radically slow.

At the time,  I assumedthat they must have been aircraft.  But it&apos;s been a long time since then,  and I haven&apos;t ever seen any airplanes,or whatever, that even remotely resemble the objects I saw.I have just recently gained access to the Web,  and being amused by UFO stories,  I found my way to a couple of theUFO pages.  While browsing at Rutgers,  I ran across some reports of &quot;triangular UFO&apos;s&quot;, which made my hair stand on end.  Up to that time,  I had not heard of &quot;triangular&quot;UFO&apos;s.  Here&apos;s what I saw in late August, 1974 while Iwas in the backyard of my house in Campbell, CA (South SFBay area).I was laying on the ground, looking through a pair of 20 power binoculars.  My feet were pointed east, and the binoculars were pointed slightly to the right of straight up,  at about the one o&apos;clock position.  Something went through my field of vision, moving right to left.  I caught up to it quickly,  and saw two objects flying in close  formation,  one behind and to the right of the one in front.They were both the same size, shaped like equilateral triangles with straight edges,  flying point forward. Their color appeared to be flat slate grey,  against a deep blacksky.  There were no features, and I saw no lights, or glow of any kind.  They appeared to be illuminated by the citylights.

The craft in front appeared more steady than  the trailing one, and the distance between them fluctuated randomly,  varying from nearly touching, to a maximum of a triangle length.  When the rear one began to lag,  it would suddenly snap back to a comfortable distance from the front one.  My impression was that it looked as though they were being manually controlled by pilots, and as if they had very high power to weight ratio, and like they were somewha thard to control.I watched them for about 8 to 12 seconds.  During that time,they maintained a due north heading, and covered about 80 to 90 degrees of azimuth.  After I lost sight of them,  I waited for several minutes for any sound.  I heard nothing.The binoculars were 20x50, with a field of view of 157 fee tat 1000 yards. If you assume that the objects were about 100 feet long,  and took up about 1/3 of the field of view, then their altitude would be 2000 yards, or 6000 feet, and their speed would be 568 mph.  That seems pretty conventional,but I think I would have heard jets at that altitude.Furthermore,  what jets have a perfect equilateral sillouette?The closest thing I can think of (that would be flying in 1974),is the B58 Hustler.  But my view was clear enough,  that I could have seen the little bit of fuselage in the front and backof the delta wing.I probably blew the simple geometry I used for the altitude and speed calculations,  but I&apos;ve given enough facts that one could calculate height and speed for any craft of a given size.((NUFORC Note:  As the reader probably has noted, the formation did not survive the transfer from our e-mail program to our website.

EST. I observed a commercial aircraft at altitude, traveling in a westernly or northwesterly direction.  I was initially attracted to this as the commercial aircraft was trailing a beautiful con trail.  I took my eyes off the aircraft several times as I was driving, but I continued to glance up at it intermittantly, and suddenly I observed another object following behing the first aircraft at what I would estimate at under 1 mile, although I cannot be certain of exact distance.  First observed second object as it began to glow brightly as if the sunlight were glaring off of it.  Second object appeared behind and just outside of con trail at what appeared to be same altitude and speed, and traveling in same direction.  Found it somewhat puzzeling that there was no sun glare off of first aircraft, and also that there was no con trail from the second object even though it appeared to be at same a!ltitude and airspeed as the commercial aircraft.  Also, this second aircraft seemed to be following much closer than any I&apos;ve ever witnessed within the local flight corridors.  With the recent events concerning military aircraft closing on commercial aircraft from behind and triggering the commercial aircrafts anti-collision warning system, and it struck me as being rather odd that these two were reletively near one another in flight to not have such systems activate.  I observed the second object for about 10 or 12 seconds as it appeared to reflect the sunlight, it then stopped reflecting light and the glare stopped, and I continued to see an obhject but could not determine shape.  Within a few seconds of the glare from the sunlight reflecting off the second object had ceased, I lost sight of the 2nd object.  I continued to observe the first aircraft and it&apos;s con trail as it flew off into the distance.  The best I can estimate, the first aircraft was approximately over or nea!r Gettysburg at the time I made this observation.  I&apos;m sorry to say that I did not observe any unusual flight characteristics such as phenomenal or unusual speed or course deviations.  When I stated a commercial aircraft I was inferring larger sized, it may have been a large military aircraft I suppose.  I just found it unusual that  one of two objects that were apparently at the same altitude and speed, one reflecting sun and one not, and with one apparently following the other, one with a con trail and one without, was a bit &quot;unusual&quot; especially considering there relative distance of seperation!

What caught my attention readily was the very slow strob speed of the lights. I looked for other color patterns and none were visable. It is almost impossible for me to determine distance or height of objects, and no shape patterns were visable due to impending sunset.There was no noticable noise at the onset of sighting. After viewing objects for approximtely 2-3 minutes we noticed the sound of jet aircraft. Suddenly from a north-west direction two F-15 fighters flew over at a tremendous rate of speed. I would estimate that they were flying at approximately 500 feet and as they passed the ground reverberated with the sonic boom. We all watched in awe as the pairs of red strobbing lights moved tremendously fast to the east and suddenly in unison changed course to the south-east and raised altitude until they vanished.

The gas formed a halo appearance and no other lights were visible.But it was bright enough from a long distance to be clearly visible beyond the mine lights glow.It flew to the south west passing over Mt St Helena and then turned directly west toward the ocean.Note:  Almost a year later these two men witnessed another sighting of a completely different craft at another location in Lake County.This sighting lasted almost 5 hours.Additionally only a few months ago,(fall 96), they witnessed a strange phenomena on the ground near the location of the first sighting.Described as a &apos;puddle of soft black metallic shavings, maggot-like but not easily described- moving as if a magnet were being passed over themand seeming to grow before their eyes as if feeding on the landscape.They report it looked like something out of a science fiction movie!It was late morning.

It hovered overhead then slowly moved to the right, then down, then leftand then up, to form a complete square.  It hovered some more than shot diagonally up and out of sight.I was 14 years old at the time.  It was Christmastime, cause I rember sitting next to our tree watching television.  It was dusk, so there was still some daylight left.  My father was sitting in our kitchen watching the birds outside.  I heard him yell for me to come see something.  I went into the kitchen and sat next to my Dad.  He then pointed out thewindow, up into the sky.  &quot;Watch that silver disc up there,&quot; he said.  The objectI looked at was not exactly round, it was kind of a cross between round and oval.  It was really high up but you could still see it clearly.  The color of it was silver, not unlike the way some jets look today.   As I watched the silver disc, it slowly moved to the right and stopped.  Next it moved slowly down and stopped.  Now it moved directly left and stopped.  And the last move it made was up and stopped.   At the time, I don&rsquo;t remember being really amazed by it, I just thought it was&quot;kinda neat&quot; is how I think I put it then! (chuckle).  As we watched the silver disc just hover in the one spot, it suddenly shot really fast diagonally up and was gone!  Later that night, after I had gone to bed, something woke me up.  I didn&rsquo;tknow what, but I had this strange sensation (not unlike dreaming).  I was being drawn to the back of the house.  So I walked slowly to our back door and pulled the shade on the window.  Normally what I would see is the silhoutte of our backyard trees against the streetlamp.  What I saw instead was a hugh, bright, white, light!   The light was so bright it was blinding!   I was suddenly startled, like waking up from a dream. I hurtled the shade down and ran back to my bedroom!

Since it was so dark I thought they were some high antennas over the rest stop.  I could see no object, only the lights.  We had never been there before and were not familiar with the area.  There were also two smaller red lights in the area that seemed to be slowly moving.  Since our car was traveling at about 65 miles per hour, I thought they were also antennas, but !thought it was odd that they seemed to be moving.  As we passed the white lights, I said to my husband, who was driving, &quot;There are some strange lights up there.&quot;  He only had an opportunity to glance up and see the white lights, but since they were quite high in the sky, perhaps 100 feet, he only saw them momentarily. As we passed, I looked back, and there were the same number of red lights on the other side, which were blinking somewhat randomly, not in any pattern.  We continued on to Tucson, and I asked someone who was familiar with that road if they ever saw any odd lights at that rest stop, and he said he thought he had, so I dismissed them as antennas.  On the way home, we took at good look at that rest stop during the day, and there were no high antennas and no hills or mountains nearby.  We have been on that road several times since then, and once we took a frontage road near that rest stop and noticed there was a power plant about 1/4 mile from there that could not b!e seen from the highway.  Last February my husband and I again traveled to Tucson at night and stopped at that rest stop to get a few hours sleep.  The only lights we saw were some red ones on a low post that were more or less vertical, and definitely much closer to the ground than the ones we had witnessed that night.
