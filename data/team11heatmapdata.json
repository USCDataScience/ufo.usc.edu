        "description":["Light formation seen over Wareham,Massachusetts with no flashing strobes, red or green navigation lights, and no soundOn the night of August 29, 2010 at approximately 20:55 PM, Myself, along with my wife, and two other different neighbors witnessed a series of lights moving in formation from west to east in Wareham,Massachusetts, 02571. I had just returned home and was getting out of my car when these lights were observed with two other separate neighbors who were outside at the time. In all my years I have never witnessed anything as I am about to describe and this event has left me wondering what we watched to the point that I stayed up to watch the 10:00PM news to see if this event would be on TV because of how astounding an event it was for us as we watched these mysterious lights. The lights came in formation from the east starting as 1 bright light at approximately 700-800ft followed by 4 bright lights, followed by 3 bright lights, then followed by 4 bright lights,then 3 bright lights, and then lastly by 1 bright light. This formation passed directly overhead and as i! t passed directly overhead the lights went out in intensity like a candle would go out, until the lights disappeared. There were no flashing lights, or red or green navigation lights observed. The most astounding thing when this formation passed was there was absolutely no sound coming from these lights and no &ldquo;craft&rdquo; or visible shape was observed other than large white round lights. As the formation of 4 lights and 3 lights passed their intensity decreased at the same time and disappeared at the same time. The lights were all in a wing formation with the 4 lights being wider than 3 747&rsquo;s flying wingtip to wingtip at 700-800ft. I was so moved by witnessing this event that I called many of my friends and family members to share our experience. It took approximately 3-5 mins for these lights to pass from beginning to end, the weather was clear with no wind."],

        "description":["Multiple witnesses of 2 flying disks in Newark, DE on 08/29/10While driving to the Christiana Mall in Newark today, I noticed two metallic disks flying rather close to one another. They were absolutely silent and moved slightly sporadically.  The disks were spinning, but not on a perfect axis.  They were not in sync, but they stayed relatively close to one another for the approximate two minutes in which I observed them. It seemed as though they were moving closer and they flew higher extremely fast.   From my perspective, it seemed as if they flew straight up into the sky. I was able to keep an eye on the objects the whole time until I had to travel below an overpass and I lost sight of the objects, which were very far away the last time I had my eye on them. I was a passenger in a car with two other people, who both observed the objects.  Traffic notably slowed down on the exit ramp, as I assume that other drivers noticed them as well. When the car I was in parked at the mall, I got out and saw an unmarked plane, and I am! not sure if it had any relation to the UFO sighting I had witnessed minutes before.   The sighting did not have any physical effects on me or on any of the other passengers in the car that I was traveling in.  As one who takes particular interest in UFOs I was absolutely speechless to observe the sighting, and it has left a traumatizing mental effect, as the images I saw have been in my head the whole day. I am very curious as to whether or not anybody else reported the sighting."],

I then looked around to see if others had seen the object, and noticed that several other patrons were already staring skyward.  We began to ask each other if we were seeing the same thing, and if we had any idea what it was.My initial reaction was that I was seeing some sort of balloon suspended in the sky with a light shining on it.  However, I quickly realized that the light was being emitted from the object itself.  I felt very strange as I stared upwards in disbelief along with several others.  The orange orb appeared to be changing its shape.  Its movements during this time are hard to describe, but seemed to be pulsing.The nightclub featured many patrons with glow sticks and other flashing lights.  A DJ was playing electronic music from the roof terrace.  I began pointing at the object with two glow sticks to help others see what I was talking about.  At this time, it began to pull back further up into the sky.  The light became dimmer and it moved near what appeared to be a star in the sky, slightly to the west at about 60 degrees above the horizon.Over approximately the next twenty to thirty minutes, the orange glowing orb would generally move in a methodical fashion between several stars / planets in the night sky.  Sometimes it would move slowly and deliberately, while other times it would move in quick movements.  On one occasion, while pointing the light out to another individual, we watched as it slowly approached a star, and then made a semi-circle movement around the star, and then proceed in a straight line.  Based on my own amateur use of a night sky computer program, I believe that this star may have been Altair.I tried to take a picture of the object with my phone&apos;s camera. The object did not appear on the camera, however, an unexplained square orange shape appeared on one image, which I would be happy to provide if needed.  I did not see any square shapes with the naked eye.At least 15 to 20 patrons witnessed the same event over the course of approximately 20 to 30 minutes.  After I went to find others and return, patrons could no longer locate the object.The coordinates of the sighting location are 39.293&apos; North, 76.611&apos; West.I am currently a Ph.D. student at a university in the Washington, DC, area."],

Coming up on it I thought it was a helicopter (possibly looking for the couple of people that have been reported missing over the past couple weeks).   As I drove a little closer i realized that it was not a helicopter.  it was pefectly still and made no noise (windows down and no radio).  Driving under it i noticed the triangle pattern of lights.  i drove past it and turned around, in that time it was gone.   Thinking that maybe becasue where i turned around was at the bottom of a hill so maybe that was why i couldnt see it, i back tracked.  also to make sure maybe it wasnt just a pole with lights or something but it was indeed completely gone."],

I continued walking, but when I looked back a minute later I noticed that the object had not moved at all.  Thinking that this was weird I stopped and watched the object for a couple minutes.  The object continued to stay in the same spot in the sky for the entire time that I watched it. I continued walking toward my house while watching the object, and as I neared my house I ran inside to tell my family to come look at the UFO. They immediately ran out to see it, but by the time we looked again it had vanished.

We reside in a high rise building and lost sight of the object after about 2 minutes as it travelled over our building.  I was able to go onto the patio of our residence and could not hear any sound coming from the object.  It was moving at a pace consistent with air traffic , but was outside of the normal areas where we have previously seen air traffic and had no flashing lights that one would expect to see on a traditional aircraft.  The object was at an altitude that I would estimate at between 2,000 to 3,000 feet and appeared to be travelling parallel to the ground, not increasing or decreasing in altitude.  The object appeared similar to a rocket, although all that I was able to make out was the flame.  The flame was distinctly red and lacked the white or yellow colorations that I have seen when observing several shuttle launches! .  The object was heading towards the Potomac Maryland area.  The object was flying in a straight path.I am a financial services executive and have never previously reporting anything of this nature.  Given the security parameters in place in the Washington DC area, I would hope that someone would have information on this object.  I am reporting it in hopes that someone can provide me with an explanation of what this very unusual object was.  It was flying low enough that it should have emitted some type of sound and I was amazed that I could hear no noise at all.  Also the red coloration was very unusual.  Would appreciate any information."],

On a clear night if I look west I can see an aircraft approaching maybe out 30 miles or more.  As the aircraft proceeds to land I can see it all the way until about it reaches the airport approximately 15 miles east.  On ordinary nights I see several dozen planes go through.  I&apos;ve lived at this location for the last 10 years and I know the types of lights airplanes have.  Typically they have bright almost white lights for landing, and typically a blue, read or white flashing lights.   On this August night, it was about 830 PM and I just got home from work.  I live near I-75 and the Griffen Road exit in Broward county FL.  The conditions were partly cloudy with a very distant thunderstorm South East of my location approximately 25 or more miles in the area of North Miami Beach. I was on the phone when I noticed two bright light orange redish lights flying! sided by side approximately 10 miles south of my location.  The were flying at what appeared to be low speeds and in the midst of low level clouds.   The lights appeared to be bigger than what you would expect from lights shinning on an airplane at that distance.  They flew for maybe 1 minute heading west and then turned together toward the south. The light was directional for one of the objects and was not for the other.  In other words, as one of the objects turned south, its light turned with it.  The other object seemed to turn the light after it had turned south. They repeated the same flyby another 3 times.  The lights seemed to dim and then brighten as they flew by.  When the lights turned south there were no flashing strobe lights to indicate it was an airplane. My parents witnessed the lights from their car just south of my location less than a quarter mile away. I confirmed they saw and object with orange redish lights and they thought it was an airplane at first! , but my dad noticed there were no recognizable lights that a ! typical airplane would carry.  Still can&apos;t explain what it was, but would love to know if anyone else in the South West Broward area saw lights at the same time I did."],

We pulled over into a nearby plaza to get a better look and try to get some pictures.  Several other people had pulled in to look at them too.  One guy yelled out his window to us &quot;what ARE those?&quot;   We answered that we had no idea.The objects were completely silent. They left no trails.  They looked like orangish-reddish fire, they flickered, but it was clear that it was not aircraft lights (like red/white of planes).  Also they didn&apos;t appear to flash uniformily like a light bulb would.  It looked more like the flickering of fire. After a while the lights started to flicker out.  But my husband then pointed to where one of them was and we saw that we could still see something moving against the sky, it was just completely darkened.  At that point there was a commercial jet in the sky and they were moving about twice the speed of the jet.

Me and my girlfriend were driving down Riverside Dr. in sherman oaks, Ca @ 9:20pm and she pointed out these lights in the sky over the hill, south of us, which would have been over los angeles. the lights were spinning fast, and the angle that they were at was like a slanted angle. at first the lights looked like it was going away, then it started getting closer and did a crazy turn to the west. the lights were spinning very fast. and it looked as if there was several rows of lights. like a scrolling marquee.There was a red light flashing with the object that i saw when i stopped the car in the middle of the street to look. it kinda looked like a helicopters red light flashing, like a beacon, i am not sure. usually i see that light on regular flying aircrafts. but this thing had lights, rows of lights, at this wierd slanted angle and the lights were rolling.The object, like i said, at first was going away from us, heading south, then it came back over the hill and it looked like it started following the 101 freeway westward.I went home to get my camera and tried to find it but it was gone. i couldnt see it anywhere. i drove all the way to santa monica beach to se if i can catch it again. there had to have been people that saw these lights. it was a crazy, round object with lights all around it, rotating lights. i swear i wouldve thought it was a movie being filmed for a space ship.((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.

The object appear to be round and a distance from us.  We saw red lights at times and green lights at other times, however it did not function like a jetliner.  It darted strangely back and forth in the sky, almost like a zig-zag at times, other times it appeared to be circling slowly.  Three of us sat and watched for an hour and a half as it drifted around, eventually we lost site of it behind the tree.  It&apos;s flight path was eerie, at times a red halo appeared around the object.  It would move quickly to the right, stop, and then drift in another direction.  I thought it may be a weather balloon but after researching them online today don&apos;t feel that it was.  I know there are 2 military bases in proximity to the area we were camping in and questioned whether it may be some time of government craft.  Whatever it was, it was strange and unlike anything I! &apos;ve ever seen in the night sky."],

Shortly after they came outside, we also noticed a fourth object of the same type.From our vantage point looking directly south of our location, the three of us watched them move across the sky in a west to northwest path without any hint of sound or noise to be heard at all, and they appeared to be gaining in elevation.My son attempted to capture a video (that didn&apos;t work), so at 10:22 pm he finally successfully took a photo of one of the objects using his cell phone.Each one of the objects, in turn, disappeared in the approximate same position or location in the sky, roughly at an angle of around 35&deg;-40&deg; parallel from ground level and roughly 35&deg; to 45&deg; farther west of the position that I first noticed them.In total, we watched them for about 5 minutes before they disappeared in the night sky."],

On Saturday, August 28, 2010, at approximately 6:00 a.m., I observed a very bright, odd-looking  &ldquo;light&rdquo; in the eastern sky near Orion&rsquo;s belt.  It was brighter and larger than anything else in the sky.The light would glow bright and produce a huge halo around itself, then it would dim, in a very slow pulse. The light, when glowing bright, formed elongated spikes of light above and below the main part of the light. I got my binoculars to observe the light closer. With the binoculars, I could see in the center of the light three colored orbs: red, blue, green, positioned in a triangle to each other. In succession, each orb would glow bright, then dim (not flashing).I observed the light until the dawn made it impossible. During the entire time I watched the light it did not move its location in the sky; neither vertical nor horizontal.I attempted to observe the light the next morning at the exact same time and place but it was no longer there.((NUFORC Note:  Sirius is to the left of, and below, Orion.

I decided to cut through 7 lakes drive on the ride home and then get on the Thruway. When we were driving on 7 lakes road (or drive?), my girlfriend was in the passenger seat looking out the window.  We passed the silver mine pond on the left and then the road took a small dip. I was going fairly slow, about 25 mph as to avoid deer.  About a &frac12; mile after we passed the silver mine parking lot we saw bright lights to the right as we approached a slight left turn.  I slowed down a little to about 5-10 mph so we could get a better look at what we saw.  About 50 feet out over a small lake we saw 6-8 red and green lights in a row formation about 10 feet long, just over the surface of the lake. As we got closer the lights moved at a somewhat brisk pace to the right on the water&rsquo;s surface and turned off sequentially from left to right.  We only saw the lights for about 4 seconds before they disappeared completely.  There were no boats in the lake that either of us could see.  I don&rsquo;t think there is a launch on that particular lake either.  We had the windows closed but there was no noticeable noise. We didn&rsquo;t stop to turn around but instead drove onwards past other lakes but saw nothing over any of those. I told family members what I saw but no one had an explanation other than maybe a small boat someone was fishing off of. I know I didn&rsquo;t see a boat though.  There was plenty of moonlight so I think either my girlfriend or I would have seen if there was a boat.((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.

My wife said to everyone &quot;look at that!&quot; we all turned to the southeast and witnessed a diamond shaped object pulsating red/orange moving slowly to the northeast, I was able to take a compass bearing on the object of 150*. I referenced the object with two pine trees at a range of approximatley 100m across a flat open field the object was situated at an elevation equivelant to two horizontal fingerwidths above the two pine trees the object steadily moved to a bearing of 120* paused for approximatley 2 seconds and then rapidly ascended to the east at a high angle of ascent and disapeared out of site. The weather was as follows: Skies-clear with abundent stars visible and the moon was a wanning gibbous providing significant lighting, enough so that I would expect an exhaust/vapor trail t! o be visible , Winds-Calm, Temperature-Approximatlety 60*F, Humidity-Low. The object made no noise, there was no trail of exhaust/vapor visible. I did not notice any aircraft in the area at the time of the sighting. I called the NUFORC hotline to report shortly after the incident occured. As we were in the process of setting up camp a camera was not readily accessible and I did not want to take my eyes off of the object. My exact location at the time of the incident was 41* 16&apos;21.7N 72* 35&apos;51.1W."],

White light traveling at about 5,000 feet moving East to West at an extremly low rate of speed. The object viewed from binoculars appeared to be a single white light (not brilliant) viewed from front, side and rear, no sound while passing and no engine.  On 8/27/2010 while viewing it at 21:30 hours from my backyard I estimate it was approximately 2 miles away and even with me. I &quot;saluted&quot; it without the binoculars and the light faded out.  I lifted the binoculars and witnessed the light reappearing approximately ten miles away (in approximately three seconds) and then went out again. On the 28th and 29th the object reappeared traveling in the same direction. My wife witnessed it with me on the 28th.  On the 28th and 29th the light did not &quot;wink out.&quot;  As it was traveling in the direction of Selfridge Air Force Base I suspect it to be a predator drone ! or blimp, stealth fighter or experimental military aircraft considering the radar that would have captured it from the base and the jets that were availabe to scramble. Surprisingly I see no other reports and unusual that on three consecutive nights it has appeared. Last night, the 29th the light appeared less bright and more amber in color. During each viewing several aircraft could be seen in and around the vacinity at varying altitudes. I will be viewing to see if it reappears for a fourth consecutive night."],

        "description":["Strange Craft Descends from Sky in Chicago and exits the night sky rapidly to the North EastOn 8/26/2010 at 9:03pm CST I witnessed a UFO through my deck sliding glass doorway. I was looking out the window in a north east direction and contemplating taking my telescope out to view the night sky as the moon was very bright in the eastern sky low above the trees. I was looking at the constellation Cassiopeia when there was a bright star that began to descend from the constellation. As it descend it got brighter and very large then began to move in a north eastern direction rapidly.  The total experience was less than 1 minute.Background: I often lay on my couch watching television and look out a 6&rsquo;wide by 10&rsquo; high sliding glass patio doorway.  When looking out the sliding glass doors I am facing in a north eastern direction.  My wife and I live somewhat near the O&rsquo;Hare Airport and are in the direct line of incoming and outgoing air traffic.  So, I am very familiar with aircraft and their appearance both in daylight and dark night skies.  I have seen aircraft flying low and high and feel I can tell the difference between aircraft and what I saw on 8/26/2010 at 9:03pm.9:03pm 8/26/2010: I had spent the evening noticing how the sky was clear and how the moon was very bright and low in the eastern sky. At approximately 8:50pm CST I noticed a bright star below the moon and wondered if it was a planet.  I took a walk back into a spare room where I keep my 10&rdquo; Orion Dobsonian Telescope. But as it was going to be too much trouble to take it out of the storage closet I decided against it.  I walked back to the living room and lay upon the couch and was looking at the constellation Cassiopeia and noticed that from out of view above the sliding glass door a star was getting brighter and looked as though it was descending directly from the constellation. Over the next few second the star got very large, bright white and began to slow its descent. At this point I called for my wife in our bedroom reading a book to please look out the window, as the bedroom window are on the same north eastern facing wall.  She said she could not see a thing, as I assumed she had alrea! dy closed the drapes as she always does. As this conversation was happening the object had gotten very large and stopped descending. It was at a magnitude I have never witnessed before.  My wife did come out of the room and asked what I wanted her to see, as my request was unusual and I was shocked at what was happening and I think she could hear that in my voice.  I continued to observe the object and it got suddenly got very bright and moved in a north easterly direction rapidly.   When she joined me at the sliding glass door, I pointed out the object and she said &ldquo;you mean that star&rdquo;.  When my wife said &ldquo;you mean that star&rdquo;, the object had already become about an 15th of its largest size and had moved out and away from us. It moved rapidly and then disappeared into the sky in that same direction.  She said it probably was plane, but she had not witnessed the full event.Conclusion: In the two years I have been living here and observing the night sky and passage of commercial planes I have never witnessed anything like this before.  The object I saw was round and moved like nothing I had ever seen before.  It descended rapidly from what appeared to be a small star to a large round object. It hovered for a second before rapidly moving out of sight.  There were no blinking lights on the object like on the commercial craft that fly overhead constantly.  And as this was a clear night I am an amateur astronomer I cannot identify what it was that I witnessed. My only conclusion would be to say that this was an UFO."],

There were three of us in a car heading west on Saginaw Hwy. Person 1 is sitting in the passenger seat, person 2 is driving, and person 3 is sitting in the middle back seat. It was around 8:40PM, the Sun  was just under the horizon almost centered with the road no stars were visible yet. Person 1 noticed a light that was approx. 60-80 degrees vertical, and 100-120 degrees horizontal (90 degrees being centered with the road) which was really high in the sky and could be easily confused as a Star/Planet. At first it was thought to be Mars because of the reddish orange tint. Person 1 announced that there was a light in the sky when he noticed it was to close to be a star/planet, the other two started looking for it. Person 2 located the light, then the two noticed that the light was moving slowly flying in different directions at will and slowing down and resuming speed.  They also witnessed it dim ! until not visible, then fade back in, then faded back out.  Person 3 noticed the light fade back in while simultaneously the other two noticed another light higher and brighter than the original and getting brighter, thinking it was the original. At this point the three thought they were looking at the same light, person 1 and 2 kept saying, &ldquo; It&rsquo;s getting brighter!&rdquo;  Person 3 noticed that he was looking at a different light because the one he was looking at was getting dimmer then disappeared then reappeared then he noticed they were looking higher up in the sky and had to lean forward to see the other light which was really bright. Then person 3 yelled, &ldquo;oh! There&rsquo;s two of them!&rdquo; Person 1 noticed the original light, it took person 2 a little longer to find it because he was driving. We watched the lights move around, and vary in brightness then the brighter 2nd light started to head south, the other light soon followed they accelerated way  faster than we had seen them trav! el previously, and as they flew they faded out. The 1st dimmer! light w as out of sight first. We were unsure if the lights were produced from inside or reflections of the sun. This all happened within a few minutes. We kept looking in the sky for the lights but never saw them."],

I had been looking at the stars, particularly the big dipper, before I fell asleep and happened to look at it again above the minivan.  A large light, larger than the stars which compose the big dipper, but appeared almost as distant, streamed through the constellation at a very high rate of speed.  I thought it might have been a shooting star, but it wasn&apos;t moving fast enough.  Once it reached a spot below the big dipper the light dimmed slightly, and then moved back and forth (left and right) in its descent, almost playfully, before taking a straight course again and I eventually lost it over what I believe was Canada.  It was heading a due north course.  The color was white, the shape was round, and the object moved and dimmed. This was not a plane.

I stopped kissing my girl and told her to look up and tell me what she sees?  This is why I&apos;m filing the report.It&rsquo;s nothing strange to see a plane or even 5 or 6 of them I can see Westover AFB, A good part of the city of Chicopee (just over the Connecticut river) , But tonight is different, Clear and calm stars out and visible and then this object.  I thought it was nothing more than a satellite at first glance.  They move just a bit slower though.This object was the brightest thing in the night sky, and if I was to measure the thing, I estimate around  the size of an apartment building.  This light was intense.  It had height, width, and depth.My girlfriend and I watched this bright light move from the Southeast, toward the east for about a minute, and then it changed direction three separate times, almost a slow zig- zig.  Like it was crawling in the sky, then it moved faster toward the South, (heading over Springfield for about 4 more minutes? We then saw what looked like jets going after this object, like it was trying to chase it.  The jets couldn&rsquo;t keep up with it though, it proceeded to increase speed and then it was gone.I&rsquo;ve seen some pretty explainable things in the sky at my home before, just nothing like this."],

There were four bright gold/yellow lights hovering on our right side as we headed toward Tawas, MI.  The lights would hover...then disappear, then reappear.  The two to the farthest right would fly close together and then fly apart.   The weather was clear and the night was very bright from the moon.  There are very few artificial lights out along 55 since it runs through farm country and toward Lake Huron.We are both college graduates, professionals in the field of education.   We are over the age of 60.  We are of course trying to rationalize this sighting because people might say we are &quot;nuts.&quot;"],

        "description":["Silent White Orb UFO followed by other Unidentified CraftAugust 24, 2010 On August 24, 2010 around 8 pm or so, my girlfriend and I were relaxing outside our apartment in West Nashville, TN.  The sky was clear, with a full moon illuminating the sky considerably.While looking at the moon we witnessed a very bright, solid white, orb-like object float into our field of view.  We don&rsquo;t know where it originated from as it seemed to have simply appeared.As we watched the light, we witnessed it accelerate fluidly and slow down just the same.  The object was able to make left, right, up, and down movements while changing altitudes quickly.  This object was totally silent, and it traversed the length of our house, but must have been at least a couple of miles away.  The light then moved behind the trees just behind our house.  Yet, being as bright as it was, we were still able to maintain visual contact and track its movement.  We were at this point standing on my neighbor&rsquo;s porch, my girlfriend on my right, when the object vanished.  Simultaneously, a shooting white light shot off into space faster than lightening.  The light trail was almost imperceptible to the eye, and it&rsquo;s duration a fraction of a second.  Almost like a reverse shooting star.At this point, we were stunned because we knew it was like nothing we had ever seen.  As we sat and discussed the object/light, we continued watching the sky. It couldn&rsquo;t have been mo re than 5 or ten minutes since the other object vanished when we began to see multiple high-altitude aircraft flying towards the area where the object had been.  These aircraft made no sound, and had blue and red quick flashing/blinking lights.  These lights flashed quickly and they appeared to be set in a rectangular shape or pattern.  One after another, these aircraft continued to appear at what looked like the same altitude and speed; the latter being hard to estimate.  At one point, it appeared these craft were assuming a triangular formation or were flying in a formation directly above where we witnessed the first object.I estimate seeing at least 10 of these aircraft, and I do not believe these were commercial aircraft.  I think it&rsquo;s possible they were military in nature, and that they also may have been circling the area.  These aircraft eventually disappeared, maintaining the same direction, speed, and altitude."],

There were no objects in the sky at all, including planes. I ran a quick errand after which, about 10 minutes later, I was in my car parked in a large parking lot a couple of miles southwest of downtown Visalia.

I was looking at one of the amusement park rides and noticed ascending right above it was a silver flashing metallic object that appeared at first glance to be a (chrome)  mylar balloon rising up.  The object then began to rise at a much faster rate and the flashing of silver light became brighter not dimmer with altitude gain.  The object rose straight up at least 500 feet from where I first saw it and was not affected by any winds aloft that would usually sway a balloon horizontally.  The object than became fixed in the sky in a perfect stop/non swaying motion and continued to pulse with flashes of silver going dim to very bright.  Some employees from a neighboring business had just come out the back of their building and I pointed the object out to them, the three of us watched for a few more minutes as the object continued to stay fixed in the ! sky as it pulsed.   Then the pulse stopped and the object was completely gone."],

Only seconds after we saw the light we noticed a plane moving in the direction that the light disappeared on the horizon.  The light was very bright, way brighter than any star out that night.

I was bare footed and climbed on some small landscaping rocks near the pool to get higher so the block fence wouldn&apos;t be in the way.  I took a total of eight photos within less than two minutes.  When I downloaded the photos I noticed the first four had an object moving through the photos at a downward angle to the left.  I seemed to be fairly distant as I never saw it with my eyes.  It probably only took me 30 or 40 seconds to take the first 5 or 6 photos because the rocks were hurting my feet and I wanted to get down to the pool deck where I took about two more.  I showed my wife and she thought I might have had something on the lens. If I did it came off quick because the last four photos do not show the object.  I zoomed in on ! the photos to see if I could detect a shape. Two looked oval and the other two appeared to have a saucer shape.  I have no idea what it is but it is strange and I don&apos;t think anything was on the lens.  I have the unalterd photos if you want them."],

I knew it was not a planet, star, satellite, etc.  The planet Venus popped into my head, but every few minutes, they was a light red object that would circle around the white object.  Practically looked like it would come out of the white object, do a little peek show, and then disappear and this carried on for an hour.As time went on, the white light was slowly but gradually moving north/northeast-ward.  I was holding my Camcorder thinking to myself, &quot;I have to get this on film&quot;.  I recorded everything I saw and had experienced.  My father had come outside to see it for himself and he was shocked to what he was indeed looking at, it was nothing that i had seen before.At 11:15 PM my parents had gone inside for just a moment while im standing outside alone now, and the white light that was a solid circle had broken apart, making 3 circles appear into the shape of a triangle. to the left side of that, 2 more lights had came to join looking like it was going into the triangle form.  They were both a light shade of a green color with a white tint to them.  When my parents had joined me again, they saw the last end of it, which was, it shot behind the tower it was next to.  Within two minutes, it had shot up above the tower, back into its original form, a circle.Throughout the night, the red object would appear next to the white object and then disappear.  At 11:45 PM, my parents and I decided to go into a field that was close by to get a better look and sure enough, it was gone.  I did not get to record it because it happened to quick but my mother had seen it and she was stunned, speechless.((NUFORC Note:  We spoke at length via telephone with the young woman, who submitted this report, and we found her to be an exceptionally sober-minded, objective witness.

It moved VERY quicly back and forth stood perfectly still and shot out something that shined very brightly at least twice, we both saw it happen the 2nd time.  Then the ejected object invisible, turned off its lights or burned up.As the time went on, it dropped lower than our trees.  We lost sight of itat approx 1AM.

At first I figured the light to be that of a planes landing light which then dimmed which I told myself was a result of it changing altitude.  The brightness fluctuated which seemed awkward for a air craft to change altitude so much. When first spotted it was near Cassiopeia heading towards the constellation Taurus. When it was over head I spotted no additional or flashing lights and after it was heading away it remained just as bright which alerted to me this was not the landing gear of an air craft.  Just after passing Taurus now heading towards Orion the light was extinguished.I do not wish to disclose my background, but I am law enforcement related.

I live in Santa Rosa, CA.  It was right after I left Wal-mart In Windsor, Ca, (just a few towns north of Santa Rosa).  There was an Airshow going on at the Santa Rosa Charles Shultz Airport and as my girlfriend and I were walking out of walmart we were looking in the sky towards the west direction watching a jet in the sky.  Once it was out of sight we got into the car and proceeded to drive home.  Before getting on the freeway heading west on Shiloh road in Windsor Ca, myself and one passenger in my car both witnessed a very strange craft in the sky about 1000 feet ahead of us.  It was flying really low, maybe 100 to 200 feet max. above the road.  It was a cylinder object with a fan looking propeller device at the back end of it. Instead of a propeller on the front of it like a normal looking plane.  It was a bright silver, almost white looking color. It looked to be about 20 or 30 feet long by 10 to 15 feet wide-(about ! the size of a personal 1 to 2 man plane)   Like I said there was an airshow going on so I was kind of looking towards the sky when it happened, and so when I saw it I thought to myself am I really seeing this?- what is this thing flying so low and it seemed to be moving at a good speed but I could see it so clearly.  And as I thought that my friend riding in the passenger seat yelled out &quot;look at that!&quot; and we were both in such awe because we think we just a ufo.  It was wierd it looked like something that would&apos;nt even be able to fly.  I had her describe to me what she saw and she explained it the same as me.  We both went home and drew out what it looked like but she doesnt really want to look like a crazy person. Our drawings look just about similar."],

They both were intertwining with each other in a circular fashion, then they would move apart a little, then intertwine again as they moved south west.

The other object went very fast to the west for a second then almost stopped and then just drifted off to the west, it did disappear at one point then reappeared. I then lost sight of it.

The object was probably about two or three miles to the west, and less than a thousand feet above the ground, and moving at around 80 or 100 mph.  There was a white light that was blinking fast, and a red light on the rear that appeared to be moving back and forth, I could not hear any sound at all. I did not observe this through the telescope because of how fast it was moving, and i should also mention the telescope is very heavy, so it is difficult to move it around. The object was moving northbound, and as it got about five or six miles to the northwest, it started to decend, and it eventually disappeared behind some trees, possibly landing at the Lawrenceville-Vincennes airport in Illinois, and if so, was probably just an airplane, but the object made no sound at all, so i am not quite for sure what it was."],

It was locked so we started following the signs which were the color brown that said campground hoping we would find another way into the park. I am pretty sure we were actually on killens pond road at this time. When my girlfriend stopped the car to get her flip flops out of the back. I was still sitting int the car. I got impatient and got out of the passenger side. Cause we were not completely off the road she had pulled up on the right hand side of the road but the left hand side of the car was sticking out into the the road and she had the back door open. About 20 feet over the tree lines was this pretty big traingle and about 50 feet to 75 feet on back of all the lights in this odd shaped traingle was this blinking red light making this vehicle the size of a football field not making a sound. I was screaming ufo my girlfriend ! was just saying o my god o my god. It wasn&apos;t hovering but wasn&apos;t moving right either. It&apos;s hard to explain. It was like the way it went out below the trees it was changing shape. I seen houses in that direction and im hoping someone else got a look at this again we were on the road with the brown signs that say campgrounds looking over to the left side was a huge field then the tree line and houses. I was standing in the middle of the road after the thing disappeared and not one car passed the whole time. If someone in delaware seen this thing I would like you to contact me, I live in upstate new york. The only reason why this is so unbelievable to me is cause it was so big and so close and it did not make a noise, nothing it was so swift. The lights were not extremely bright but I really couldn&apos;t get the shape of it. I know that red light in the back of it was connected by the way it moved with the object. But it was like it was so far away and out of place.((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.  PD))"],

The object traveled in a straight, unvarying course.  When it passed over a cloud I could easily estimate where it would come out again further up the path. I just happened to look up at an aircraft that was heading south (I presume coming from Vandenberg due to its low altitude) and saw the object pass over it.  Round, white but not reflective, no noise and at first I thought it might be a parachute from the aircraft.  But after a few seconds it was obvious it was not an aircraft.  From when I saw it to when it was out of view was between 1 and 1.5 minutes. My niece was outside at the same moment and she saw it too.  There are storms coming in from the north-west and the wind is also swirling so any balloon or something like that should not have traveled in a straight line.  I have never seen anything weird in the sky before and I get to see a lot of aircraft every day and this just stood out as quite strange.((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides little contact information.

        "description":["four fireballs moving rapidly south at 9:45pm CST west of ChicagoFirst, I wish it to be known that Morris Municipal Airport (http://www.airnav.com/airport/C09)  is 2.8 miles due north of our location.  It is a very small airport that does not handle large aircraft or carrier lines.At roughly 9:45pm CST my wife and I were in our front yard.  We were walking past the front of our house passing south when we saw two odd shapes in the sky, quickly followed by one, then another.My best description is that all four shapes were identical, and looked like fireballs, each of which cast a tail of radiation in its wake that made each object look vaguely like a glove with the fireball at the palm and the fingers (four or five) trailing in the wake (my wife saw something very similar, but not in as much detail).  They were orange-yellow, about the shade of fire you&apos;d see from a campfire.I have no way of gauging their size nor distance from the earth&apos;s surface, except to say that 5 or 6 of them grouped together would have been enough to blot out the moon from our view.We initially saw one of the shapes moving directly overhead, due south.  Then another shape seemed to appear directly overhead (or simply fly into our field of vision), then another.  At around the same time we observed the third shape overhead, we realized there was another such shape further off in the southern sky.All four shapes continued rapidly due south until they disappeared from our sight.  They did not disappear over a horizon, nor were they obstructed by trees or buildings, but rather they seemed to fly straight off into the sky until they became too small to see.We initially thought they may be skydivers, but couldn&apos;t explain the intense fire.  We also thought they might be hot air balloons, but we both concluded they were moving fast enough that we couldn&apos;t hope to catch them in our truck, even if we drove rapidly in a straight line after them.  We heard no sound from them whatsoever."],

        "description":["Large white craft seen on 1-70W during morning trafficOn Saturday, August 21, 2010, I was driving to Wheeling, WV to attend a wedding.  At around 10:45AM, while approaching Washington, PA on I-70W, a large object in the northern sky caught my attention.  Since there was a bit of traffic and I was driving relatively slowly, I was able to observe the object for approximately 45 seconds. The first instant I saw it, I thought it must have been a very large, low flying jet of some sort, but further observation ruled that out.  The object was long, thin, tapered at each end, with a somewhat thicker section in the middle of the craft. It was a solid white in color and was flying at about 8 inches (visually) above the treeline.  It was at least five inches long at arm&apos;s length from end to end, and maybe about an inch maximum from top to bottom at the thickest part. Again, it appeared to be very large.  I could see that it was definitely gliding toward my general direction at a steady speed.  I could not distinguish the exact! shape of the craft as I was looking at an approaching object dead-on. In my opinion, it was probably a large disk or chevron-shaped craft.  There was no sound and I saw no contrail. It was very startling due to the size and nature of the object.  It was unlike anything I am familiar with seeing in the sky.  I was unable to see where it went after I drove past it.I know for a fact that several other people had the chance to see this object, as there were many vehicles on the road at the time, the object was quite noticeable, and traffic was moving relatively slowly.  I&apos;m extremely curious to see if another witness might read this report and come forward with their own account.  Perhaps someone at a different vantage point was able to get a better view of the shape of the object."],

I started snapping a few pictures when my friend says, &quot;is it moving?&quot;  I focused back at the light and off my camera and noticed in fact it was!  Slowly moving downward towards the horizen line then stopped again.  I changed my camera to video mode and started recording.  It then started moving left along the tree line in the distance prolly about 20 miles away or so.  We then proceeded to follow it up the street walking 100-200 feet away from the house.  It would stop and move constanly.  It flickered several different colors at one point from blue to green to orange and red.  It was definately not a plane with blicking lights; this was way too big. It eventually went below the tree line so we got into my dads truck and went to a higher point few streets over and I started recording it again.  It made no sound.  We watched as it sat still for about 5 minutes then it proceeded to go below the horizen line again.

I have never claimed to have seen a UFO, nor am I sure what exactly I saw last night.  I&apos;ve come to this website to see if any other&apos;s witnessed what I saw or if there is some kind of reasonalble explanation.  While sitting in front of my home, I noticed a very bright white light whith a red hue low in the western sky.  At first I thought it was a low flying plane, as there is a small airport nearby.  But then I noticed it wasn&apos;t really moving. It was hard to determine if it was in our atmosphere or in space.  Then I began to think perhaps it was a very bright star or planet, but it just seemed too big for that and the red hue didn&apos;t make sense.  I couldn&apos;t really determine what it might be. I called to my wife and a visting friend who witnessed it as well. Star, plant, plane; they came to the same conclusion as me.  I called a neighbor and he and his family witnessed it as well. They had a pair of binoculars and ! indicated that it was round with a red hue.  They could not determine if it was in our atmosphere or not.  We watched it for about 15-20 minutes, and then it made an apparent wobble to the left and the white light disappeared.  You could then see a faint red twinkling hue in it&apos;s place.  At one point, about 3-4 min. following the bright light&apos;s disappearance, there was another flash or shimmer resembling the largewhite light that lasted about 2 seconds.  I watched the red twinkling hue for another 5-10 minutes before clouds moved in and obscured my view completely.  I live in North Asheville, and called a friend in South Asheville to see if he had noticed the light.  He, in fact, had noticed it while driving home, and had thought it to be an oddly large, bright planet.  He suggested that perhaps it was a large meteor.  I called the local paper shortly after to see if anyone else had reported it, but no one had at that time."],

That portion of the sky was visible to me the entire time I was on the phone and the object was noticeable as soon as it appeared.  The object seemed to stay in place, relatively motionless for the entire length of the sighting.  Being unsure of what the object was I had my fifteen year old son come outside and take a look.  He verified that the object seemed to be hovering in the same spot.  At that time I called a friend who was working approximately 6 miles from my location.  He proceeded outside and spotted the object from his location.  At that time I went inside the house to get a pair of binoculars to try and get a better view.  Being unable to locate my binoculars I utilized the clo! sest thing I had, which was a 12 power rifle scope (unattached from the firearm).  With the aid of the scope I could make out what appeared to be faint red lights around the circumference of the object.

I saw in the southern sky, I would say about 3 miles away at a 30-40 degree angle from horizon an orange ball moving slowly across the sky.  I watched it for about 20 sec and I couldn&rsquo;t make out any blinking lights that indicated it was a plane, so I watched it about 10 more seconds.  At that point I made a decision to go inside and grab my astronomy binoculars to have a better look.I was able to find the orange ball in the binoculars.  I wanted to make sure I had focused them correctly, so I was adjusting one of the eye pads, keeping the binocs on the object.  The object was glowing orange, but had some red and white in it as well.  As I was adjusting and watching this move across the horizon it faded out and then got brighter, and then it just vanished.  Was not seen in the sky anywhere. It was simply gone.What made me pay attention to it in the very beginning was that it was very similar to some red/orange balls I witnessed on July 4th at Lake of the Ozarks in Missouri.  To me it didn&rsquo;t act like a plane or helicopter.  It was an orange glowing ball slowly making its way across the horizon and it simply blinked and then disappeared."],

It seemed odd to us that stars would be aligned so perfectly like that, so we kept watching to see if they were planes, or thought maybe our shifting view would clarify what they were.Our view was obstructed for two minutes, and as we approached Palos Verdes Drive W. (we were on Via Coronel at this point), the lights came in to view again, unchanged.  Our view was obstructed again as we approached the Palos Verdes Drive West, and was blocked by trees as we headed North for around 1/4 mile.  When there was a break in the trees, we pulled over to give it a better look, and again we saw the lights.The lights were definitely above land, though not extremely high in the sky.  They were as bright or brighter than how Venus usually appears.  We guessed that there was around 1000 ft between each light.  It seemed odd to us that stars would be aligned so perfectly like that, and while we were watching, the middle and upper light started flashing.  The light on top was flashing green and the middle light flashed red.  This continued for approximately one minute, then suddenly a fourth white light zoomed in from the East and into position directly over the green light, and a second or two later the lowest light took off in the opposite direction.Following that, the red and green lights turned white again.  Then one by one, the three remaining lights appeared to be moving away into the opposite direction of where we were.  First, the uppermost light became fainter and fainter, then the middle light and finally the lowest light remained, becoming fainter, and then disappeared.  The entire event probably lasted 30 minutes, though the initial alignment that we saw may have been like that for awhile.(My cell phone battery was dead, or I would&apos;ve taken video of this!)"],

To the south, southwest I could see the moon.  Sitting in a chair facing south I tilted my head back to look at the sky.  I saw a noticeably bright white star, I thought at first it must be a plane... so I watched it for a few and then it suddenly moved very very swiftly in the north direction and stopped very abruptly.  My second thought was a meteor, after all we did just have a meteor shower this past weekend, but the very bright &quot;star&quot; never disappeared or burned out like a shooting star would have and it stayed in the same spot and just as bright until I mentioned it to friends who were also present at the time.  They shrugged it off and said &quot;satellite&quot; I quickly dismissed this option because of how quickly it moved and stopped.Don&apos;t satellites stay in continuous motion in orbit around the earth??  Wouldn&apos;t that make them move very slowly across the sky?  And would they be as bright as the moon in blue sky?   I&apos;m not sure if this is the same or similar thing people around the world have seen lately, but it sure does make you wonder."],

It was very high in the sky and passing under and threw the clouds.  I called the guy who was putting the carriages away and told him to look up at it.  He did and he saw it too.  I said its not a plane or a helicopter or a jet and he agreed.   We both thought maybe it was an airship shaped in a rectangle shape.  It looked like it had windows on one side and the back three quarters was a light blue color with occasional strobe lights on each side.  It glided slowly across the sky and into the clouds.  Later, I looked up Airships on the internet and found out that there are many types of airships nowadays and that some are even shaped like ! sauser ufos and that they now have passenger rides on airships and that companies make personal airships for people customized to whatever shape or design they want.  Also learned that the Army has made one the size of a football field to do spy work over Aphghanistan and saw a picture of another unmanned spy airship that looks like a ufo.  They said they can also operate them remotely.  So whatever it was, it could have been one of these new airships but it definately wasnt a regular air craft.((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.

        "description":["Cigar shape rolling through skyMy boyfriend called me on the phone and told me to get the camera and run down to the parking lot because he spotted a UFO.  He had just arrived home and noticed a metallic cigar shape flying above the treeline.  The camera battery was dead but I got our dog and ran down anyway. By the time I got to the parking lot, the object had flown out of sight behind some hills.  We got in the car to drive a bit in the general direction it went and see if we could spot it again, but we couldn&apos;t see due to all the hills in the area.  About five minutes later, we headed to our apartment building.  We went to let the dog use the bathroom and that was when I spotted the object, headed back in the same direction it came from.  It looked like a jet with no wings, and it made no sound. I could not see any markings.  It appeared to be rolling like a barrel as it made its way through the sky.  My boyfriend estimated it to be at 1,000 ft. altitude.  He also saw an antenna on the craft which I did not notice.  We watched it for about a minute until it flew out of sight.  About two years ago we saw an object that was the same shape and also appeared to &quot;roll&quot; or rotate as it flew before in this town, also in broad daylight.((NUFORC Note:  Source of report elects to remain totally anonymous; provides little contact information.

We were driving south when when two of us noticed two extremely bright orange-yellow fireball type orbs that were staying static in the air.  Once we noticed the objects we stopped the car and began to closely observe them.  The UFO&apos;s which were two at the time began to slowly rotate around each other as we observed them.  The UFOs were extremely low, barely above the tree line.  The UFOs were from our perspective too our South West. After a few minutes an even more peculiar incident happened.  We observed another orb of extreme luminosity fly by us from the north flying south west.  As our attention was drawn too this third UFO the two orange orbs disappeared.  We proceeded to get in the car and follow the UFO going south down the road. We stopped 1/2 mile down the road and stopped the car to observe this new object.  ITs important to! note that none of the objects exhibited any of the typical characterisicts of a plane of helicopter........when the first UFOs were static and moving there was no audio ambience or sound emitted from them.  This was the same with the third UFO. FLying as low as they were there should of been some type of sound.  All of the UFOs were approximately at a viewing degree of approximately 30 degrees, they were all flying so low that they were barely above the tree line.  The lights were all so bright that it confounded us.  None of us have ever witnessed anything similar to this. And this incident happened with no houses or cars around to emit any source of light.  Also all of the UFOs were strobing throughout the duration of the sighting."],

        "description":["UFO sighted over Antioch, CA 08/16/10 Stationary for 10 minutes.Two of my friends and I had just arrived outside my friends apt. complex. We were waiting for one of my friends to get out of the car. while we were watching him take forever to get out, i noticed a very bright pulsating light in the sky directly lined up with his car just miles in the distance.(i&apos;d say it was over the delta near travis air force base)Due North.One of my friends thought it was a planet the other thought it was a star going supernova. i&apos;m well versed in my astronomy and told them that there was no star or planet in that direction (due North), especially none that bright.We watched as it sat completely still, hanging in the sky for about 5 mins when two men got out of their car and were going into the apt. complex; so we stopped them and asked them if they thought that it looked like a helicopter. they said,&quot;hell no! that&apos;s a UfO.&quot; they watched it with us for about one minute and went inside. it was still stationary at this time and still very bright and pulsing.At that time two of our friends came out of the complex because one was getting a ride and the other was walking her out. As soon as they saw it one of the girls said that&apos;s a UFO, we didnt even tell her what we thought it was. The other girl saw it and ran into the house because she was afraid. The girl got her ride and we still sat watching it.The object then started to dim, then brighten, then go even more dim still. as it did this it moved slightly up, then stopped;slightly left, stopped; and up once more and stopped. The whole time my two other friends were trying to call the people we knew in the apt., but none of there phones were working.We were thinking it was getting bigger for a moment, then i realized it was coming straight toward us. the object moved very slow and was completely silent. when it did reach us, it was 100% lined up with our position, i mean when we looked up it was not to the left or to the right, it was right on top of us! we waited for it to pass a little then ran inside our friends apt. to try and get them to come out to see it. they came out as it was nearly passing the apt. complex&apos;s walls.We watched it fly into the distance when it suddenly split into to separate lights with a good amount of distance between the two. we watched it until we couldn&apos;t see it any more. The whole experience lasted about 15-16 mins. After the experience was over my two friends that saw it the longest with me, and myself, felt very ill and shaky.After we went back inside we stepped out for a cigarette , this was about five minutes after we went in; we saw a black stealth bomber, running below super sonic, flying in the exact same direction as the UFO.I checked MUFON&apos;s website the next day to see if anyone reported it. The stealth bomber was sighted slightly more south than my town, which is the direction it was heading, coming from the north. The object was not reported that night, but for the previous night there was a report of an object moving in the exact same pattern,(up,stop,left,stop,up,stop, and then flew right at them) just about 20 miles North of my town."],

I was out walking my dog at about 9:30pm it was just about fully dark out with a half moon to light up the sky.  I just happened to look up into the sky in time to see a dark object in the sky flying faster than any aircraft I have ever seen.  It had no lights and made no sound.  It was out of my viewing range in a matter of 5 seconds.  It was flying really low between 1500 and 1800 feet.  But it was too dark to see anything physical about it or any shape.  There is no military base near here and just the shear speed of it just really makes me wonder what I had just seen.((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.

        "description":["Triangle Shaped Craft (3 white lights and Dull red Light)My buddy and I were coming back from a movie in Philadelphia.  We were at an intersection Hulmeville and Gibson when we saw a really bright light moving across the sky way in front of us.  We got a green light and started moving towards the direction the light was going; however, it now was coming in our direction.It seemed to have made a complete turnaround in a matter of 25 seconds or less.  It then changed direction again crossing over Hulmeville road.  At this point I still was not convinced until I got away from some of the high trees and saw it had stopped.  It was just sitting in the sky about maybe 800 feet up give or take.  At this point the brighter lights were no longer on just 3 dull lights (white) and one red light which were not blinking.  All the lights though were dull at this point even the red one.Then I rolled my window down and heard nothing.  I could hear cars, people, and one point even crickets but no sounds that something should make just hovering there in the sky.  It then slowly started to turn and the point or tip of the triangle was pointing downward as it rotated.  Then we had to keep moving and it slowly started crossing the houses over school nearby.  The sighting was about 5 minutes but we turned around about 5 extra minutes to get back to that area and we could not see it anywhere.We looked and looked and nothing.  I believe it was the same craft design wise that me and my ex saw in December 8th 2002 in Croydon.  I believe that this is probably our spacecraft that are reverse engineered off of Alien spacecraft.  This and the one in 2002 are mostly TR-3B or a variant of it."],

Once the object floated way above any bridge in downtown she knew it was no car.  Thats when she called for me.  I looked at where she was pointing, and instantly knew it was something I had never seen before!  So I pointed my camera and pressed record, but my camera was still set on photo.  So I snapped a quick blurred picture of it before I switched it to video.  I think I got some good footage of the orb floating up, down, and all around until it flickers away into nothing.I still have the raw footage on my camera as evidence to it not being altered with special effects.  I have a simple little digital camera, which would be impossible to add special effects to video on it.The light seemed to be solid blue on one side and solid red on the other.

Then I looked up and up from the ground somewhere  ahead of us flew amber tinted oval lights.  They look like what a steet light in  the dark.  One after the other they flew up at a 45 degree angles and then  disappeared before our eyes as they went off into the distance.  At one time  one got so close to the other that it looked like it was on top of the other  one.   As we watched several fly up into the sky I ran to my parents house and  got my dad who witnessed the last couple fly up.  We counted 9 in a row.Neighbors at the end of the street were also standing in awe and witnessed  the same.   We also ran into a group of boys who had been riding their bikes, who were standing on the sidewalk watching the sky in awe and asked us what  we thought we all had just seen.  It was scary and amazing at the same time.We immediately thought of UFO&apos;s.  After watching them fly off we did see an  airplane in the sky headed another direction.  We knew after seeing the  airplane that what we saw tonight was not an airplane, helicoptor, or  anything else we have ever seen in the sky!"],

(would be bright then go out)...then return to its position. the person sitting next to me witnessed the same movement for verification. another coincidental weird factor was the thunder lightening and showers that followed twenty minutes later. the skies were crystal clear ...the storm rolled in ...thundered and lightening ...rained then went away like nothing ever happened. i think the storm might be a coincidence just due to the fact that the entire sighting was so overwhelming? but we saw an orange ball of light. we saw our first Unidentified Flying Object.the next day there was a millitary huey helicopter that flew around for a couple hours as well. again that could have been a coincidence...but i think the nearest military helo pad is about an hour away?"],

We were told by the dispatcher that we perhaps saw Meteors from the Pegasis Meteor showers that were going on.  We have been watching them and know the duration of a meteor or shooting star is usually seconds.  We actually saw it a second time but further away and lower on the horizon.  The direction of travel was NNE from the Big Dipper towards Cassiopia however it was actually below Cassiopia constellation.  When  it disappeared it looked like a star however when it was overhead, two of the persons smelled a burning smell in the air.  The other two did not.The 911 Center did call us back and stated that Bishop International Airport did not have any reports of aircraft in trouble."],

They were silent and holding still. They were placed one directly above the other and very close to each other. They were brighter than anything I have ever seen. I would estimate that they appeared to be some thousand times larger than Venus as she rises.I glanced away for a mere second to check what my dog was doing. I then looked back to where the fireballs were but they were gone.I am a retired, educated person, and the author of one of the history books about Kennewick.

The bodies are thin and and seem like they are all walking. There are no arms just a dot and straight long line the part attached to the head is one straight line and the last two lines are the legs spread apart as if they are walking.  I just thought it seems funny and this picture is painted on the parking lot of all silver paint (alien paint maybe or of some chemical.  It&apos;s not real messy, but it is big enough that peo! ple were scare to park their cars there.  The the direction of the picture had to come from directly above my apartment.  The three aliens had to have landed on the roof top and make this picture.  The picture is pointed directly towards my window.  The silver paint is nothing like I&apos;ve seen it.  I don&apos;t think it can be removed.  I think it has to be completely painted over or dug up to remove the object shape on the ground.  The whole complex has to of seen this object or painting in the driveway. The channel that I seen this television show is the history channel about the aliens. I believe this is an contact from the other side. When I took the pictures, I feel really funny after I took the picture.  Thanks for letting me report this."],

She is sure it was not a blimp, plane or helicopter because of the rocking motion it made, and because it was clearly saucer shaped, like two equal sized saucers stuck together.  It should also be noted that she is a Christian and previously a staunch non-believer in extra-terrestrial life.  She was so excited, she called me and I got on the roof of our house in Burbank but could see nothing.  However, I did see a helicopter over the hills, which may have been sent to investigate.

Noticed a brightly flashing object in the WSW sky.  Thought it was an airplane because it had several different colors being displayed.  It was the brightest object in the sky except for Jupiter which was to the east area of the sky.  Moon not visible as it had already set.As I watched I realized the flashing lights did not move in relation to the trees in the yard of the house next door to the south of me.  After 5 minutes (40 miles of jet airliner flight distance) it still remained in the same position.I walked to where my driveway meets the street some 100 feet west of where I first spotted them to get a better view of the lights.  They were still in the same place.I returned to my house side door and retrieved my 20X80 binoculars to determine if I could see anything with the use of them.  Going back to the driveway entrance I used the binoculars and could see that the lights were changing colors and very quickly.  Red, blue, white, green colors were visible with the glasses but of course the image was all over the place. I placed them on the top of the fence post at the entrance of my driveway and although it steadied the image somewhat it was still only a bouncing globe of lights moving around.  Like trying to watch a star with high power glasses, almost impossible.Although I watched the lights for about 30 minutes, less the time to get the binoculars, they appeared to remain the same intensity and with multicolors.The position was about where I would expect to see Arcturus, the star the tail of the Big Dipper leads to.  Maybe it was that star, although I have looked at it hundreds of times, including from the flight deck of jet airliners.  I have never noticed it have coloring and flashing brightly like it did tonight.The object was about 35 degrees above the horizon and the sky is clear although there could have been some smoke from the forest fires that occur this time of year adding particulates to the atmosphere and perhaps giving a view that I have never seen before.I stopped watching at 23:45."],

I myself in the driver seat while my mother riding up front, sat in the passenger seat.  When the sighting occurred my mother and I were the only ones who were able to witness it because my girlfriend and my nephew sat in the back seat, meanwhile my nephew was sound asleep.Next, we seen a streak of light above us, similar to a shooting star.  First it appeared to be a shooting star, then in astonishment, it appeared to be in a horizontal oval, it didn&apos;t just shoot through the sky fading from sight.  At the sight of this abnormal object it seemed to be traveling in the same direction we were headed, but to my suprises not as slow as an airplane or helicopter, and at first not as fast as a shooting star.  Yet it seemed to be going at an acceptionally fast speed.  It also didn&apos;t have any sound, in reference to any airplane or jet.  Which a jet would have been a good explanation except the fact that a jet doesn&apos;t fly silently.In addition, this object in the sky didn&apos;t appear to be flying at a high altitude.  In fact it seemed pretty low as if it were a helicopter trying to find someone or something.  At first it was just a stream of light then it came lower then it was, not by much but still a little lower.  Then it suddenly picked up speed and the aluminescence grew into a stream of light trailing a ball of light.  Then it seemed to reach a higher area in the sky and at this moment it changed colors immediately from white, to red, then instantly blue and within a fraction of a second it was gone.  It almost seemed to have maybe gone behind a thick cloud, due to the weather we&apos;ve been having.  Then my mother and I realized, there wasn&apos;t any clouds in the immediate area of the night sky.Ultimately, the sight was both shocking and surprising, given it all occured within the most two seconds, or less.  I confidentally believe what I witnessed wasn&apos;t anything in our United States technological capabilities, unless it was an SR-71 Blackbird in central Floridas air space.  It&apos;s one of the only flying objects to my knowledge that would fly close to the speed, without sound, and disappear from sight instantaniously with little conflict, compared to what I witnessed.  Besides the SR-71 doesn&apos;t hit an immediate &quot;warp speed&quot; and aluminate in red then blue and disappear.  I know it sounds tampered with but the object had a blunt oval shape to my sight, possibly due to the engle of visual but to my knowledge it was practicaly oval."],

She estimates the distance would be up higher than any conventional aircraft.  The lights had a strobe pattern blink flash repeat. Light Colors were in a row through the middle of the ship.  The colors were 3-5 repetitions of green, yellow and pinkish purple.  The lights and shape of the craft were stranger than any she has ever seen.  The path it traveled she said it flew up a little bit then it hovered and shaked as it left horizontally.

I HAPPENED TO LOOK UP INTO THE TREES IN FRONT OF US AND SAW AN ORANGE LOOKING ORB.  I ASKED MY DAUGHTER &ldquo;what is that?&rdquo; she looked and saw the orange orb.  We followed it through the trees moving northeast.  It was hard to follow through the trees.  We kept following it for about 4 or 5 minutes.  Then we went down into the street but could no longer see it.  When we got back up on our deck , we saw it through the trees and it was growing larger and coming at us.  We did not stay outside to see where it went next.The orb was somewhat circular with a bright orange glow.  There was no sound but it was slowly moving. It seemed as if it was coming to our trailer as we were watching it.  It&rsquo;s size was about &frac14; the size of a full moon.The direction it first appeared was over the national forest close to moosilaukee mountain.After about ten minutes we went back out with my son and nephew.  We could no longer see it.  At no time did we hear any sound.((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.

The location of the incident Warren, New Hampshire, in White Mountains national forest near Mooshillaukee Mountain, off route 118.  We were facing in a North West direction sitting at a campfire with low flame as we were at the end of our time outdoors.Calmly we were discussing and chatting, when my mother asked me, &quot;What is that?&quot;  I got up and went toward the fireplace to look around the canopy opening.  I then saw a glowing orb shape the size was a quarter of the size of the moon.  The color was gold orange and the object was slowly crossing the horizon.I went through possibilities in my mind of what it could be.  It was not a planet as it moved. It was not a coloring changing star. It did not move in the fashion of an airplane.  It did pause in flight. There was no sound.We went onto the deck of our trailer to follow its flight path.  The object was pulsating in intensity and brightness.  The object remained in the same spot for about a minute.  Then we lost sight of the object behind foliage.I went toward my mother&rsquo;s vehicle which was parked toward the south to see if the object to could be seen at a father distance or if changing height would allow better viewing.  We went back onto the deck of our trailer from the car area while looking for the object to see where it had gone.I then saw the object change direction and it increased in size coming toward us.  The object&rsquo;s size doubled and the light intensified no longer pulsating as it appeared to be coming closer to us.  We then went into the trailer to avoid confrontation and started to use the phone and internet.  No interruption of any technology was evident."],

Both was a amber color similar to a candle light. the triangular one was on top towards the right of the oval.  they both hovered and it seemed like to be about maybe 5-10 miles away from where i was standing. first it both held its position for about 30 seconds then the triangular shape ufo started to diminish, it wasn&apos;t fast but very slow forming a second oval shape. that took about 20 secs, then the same triangular ufo that turned into a oval gotten smaller but didnt seem to more farther in distance.  it became a little spec of light and disappeared. keep in mind the lower oval shaped one was still there this whole time. ok it now gets better. then the oval shape one still hovered at the same position for about 3-5 minutes. then a light started to appear to the bottom left of the oval! shape and started to form a oval i think it was the second craft coming back. by then i was so amazed and a little freaked out. they both hovered for another 2-3 mins not moving or anything. then the lower left one started to fade. then the single oval shaped craft that never moved stood there another 2 mins then faded. that whole sighting lasted about 10 mins. it never changed color, just shape. i didnt hear any noise at all.. keep in mind the direction that i was looking at was towards McConnell air force, Cessna aircraft, and boeing. so it could have been a experimental plane but i know for sure a plane when i see one because i used to work in the aircraft industry. i truly believe i seen a UFO. i didnt have my phone on my at the time so i couldnt take any pictures."],

        "description":["Two spheres of light observed dancing in the sky near Port Angeles, WA.Last week, my boyfriend and I were on an Alaskan cruise. We are both in our mid-20s, college graduates, work regular jobs, have NO experience with UFOS or aliens.  While travelling back to port at Seattle from Victoria, BC, we happened to notice a meteor shower during the late evening of August 12th.  We ended up watching this meteor shower for several hours.  The meteors were amazing, ranging in many sizes and colors.  Around 1:40am (now Friday the 13th), my boyfriend noticed something unusual in the sky.  He saw two uniform spheres of light appear in the sky, move in a figure 8 motion, and then disappear.  He quickly tried to explain this to me in his bewildered state, but within a few seconds these two lights appeared in the sky again and we both saw them.  The spheres were always equidistant apart, as if they were attached by some invisible pole, and danced around each other very quickly and sharply.  The lights moved in a zig zag pattern, back and forth for abo! ut 5 seconds before flying a straight path over the ship and we could no longer see them from our balcony.  The lights were a little larger in comparison to the stars and seemed to appear from mid air in the sky.  We sat in shock for a very long time, trying to come up with a logical explanation, and hoping to see them again. These lights were absolutely not meteors, they moved in several different directions and left no light tail, and they were solid white lights, no blinking or shimmering. We also thought that possible the military was trying some new type of aircraft, maybe a new invisible plane and all we could see were the two lights on it?   But there was no sound, and with the speed these lights were traveling I&rsquo;d expect a very loud rocket sound.  So my theory is now that these lights were either one or two UFOs, maybe aliens use meteor showers to hide their arrivals?   I would definitely love to know if there is a logical explanation, I don&rsquo;t think I will ever stop wondering what we saw and it may just drive me crazy!  This was seen while we were in the Strait of Juan Fuca/Clallam Bay near Port Angeles.((ADDENDUM FROM WITNESS))Hello Peter, Thank you for getting back to me so quickly!  I will definitely have my boyfriend prepare his own independent statement.  Its just absolutely unbelievable, I never expected to see a UFO in my entire life.  Half of me still thinks there is no way I could have seen a UFO and there has to be some explanation, but the other half knows that there is nothing on Earth I know of that moves like that, and there is no way we both could have imagined seeing the exact same thing.  To be honest, I feel a little crazy.  I&apos;ve always believed in other life, its bogus to think that we are the only living planet in an unimaginably vast galaxy,  I guess I just never expected to see for myself.  Either way, it was a once in a lifetime experience and I would definitely welcome another! I will have my boyfriend, Eyad, submit his report though the web form.  Thank you again for contacting me!((END ADDENDUM))((2ND ADDENDUM FROM WITNESS))Hello Peter, You can definitely use my additional comments. I will also try to create an illustration, Im creatively and artistically challenged, but will do my best!((name deleted))((END ADDENDUM))"],

The objects were triangular in shape, vertical with the apex pointing straight up. Inside the triangles were undulating white, green and red lights that morphed around inside the triangles like colored bubbles inside a lava lamp.  Each triangle was about the size of a dime at arm&rsquo;s length.Initially the triangles passed from the south toward the north in a somewhat horizontal path and stopped due east about 45 degrees above the horizon.  At the same time I saw an airplane pass in front of the triangles and then I saw a satellite pass over them. They were bigger than the jet airliner so they must have been at least 100 feet on a side. The objects were distinctly different from either the airliner or the satellite. The objects were about as high as the plane and beyond it a ways. Once the triangles stopped, they slowly moved around in the sky, up, down and sideways with no particular pattern to their movements.  At times they hovered nearly still in their positions and then they would resume their dance.  The objects were never touching and did not remain adjacent to one another.  Eventually they started moving directly upward.  The triangle on the right stayed in position lower than the one on the left.As I watched the objects ascend, a deer entered my yard and startled me.  When I looked back, I could no longer see them."],

Though I thought this was unusual, we dismissed it and looked elsewhere in the sky for signs of the meteors.  When I returned my attention to the star, I found that it had moved Westward and toward the horizon significantly.  We then watched its motions for several minutes, noting first to ourselves and then aloud that the object was swinging strangely from side to side.  This seemed curious especially due to its apparent distance from us.  If the presumed object seemed to us the size of a very bright star and it was performing such wide swinging motions and there was only a slight breeze that night, I assumed this might not be a conventional aircraft or an object being manipulated by air currents.Thinking the rapid movements of our eyes may have caused this pattern of movement, I scanned the sky for a star and attempted to produce the same affects but could not.  The motion seemed to be real and not a product of autokinesis.We procured my Meade ETX-70AT Telescope upon my boyfriend&apos;s suggestion.  Magnification did not clarify any apparent shape of the object.  At times it is obscured by clouds.  Before it became obscured below the treeline, we observed it erratically blinking red, white, blue, and green.  No observed trail, surrounding haze, beams, spikes, glow or what have you.  No observed heat or odor.Did not contact the police, ufo center, press, military, or nearby airports though we observed commercial aircraft concurrently.((NUFORC Note:  Possible sighting of Venus, we wonder.

        "description":["High altitude light that faded into two small points of light, slowly moving in tandem to the south.I was up late watching the Perceids meteor shower with my main view towards the North East.  It was a beautiful, clear night with no moon.  Jupiter was hanging high over head and slightly to the south at this hour.  There were several nice meteors, two brilliant ones of note, but the rest were just tiny little streaks.  I was getting a little bit bored with looking at the same section of sky so I looked back over towards the South.  I could see Jupiter shining through the fabric of the sunshade but off to the side of the shade and directly overhead, I noticed a bright, smaller, pale, bluish, white light.  I was confused since I knew it wasn&apos;t another planet and I hadn&apos;t remembered seeing a star that was that bright. As pondered this anomaly, it just slowly faded out.  While my eyes adjusted tracking around it&apos;s position, I then got this bizarre motion sensation which really bugged me out since I was sitting stationary.  I realized then that it wasn&apos;t me that! was moving, it was a tiny light that my eye had fixed upon, it was no brighter than the background stars, and it was moving slowly towards the South.  That&apos;s when I noticed it wasn&apos;t alone.  There were two distinct, small points of light moving perfectly in unison together with one ahead of the other at a slight angle from my perspective, there was a decent gap between the two, about an inch and a half to two inches if you measured between two fingers of an outstretched hand.   A jet flying at a high altitude with it&apos;s standard running lights flashing also happened to fly overhead a moment later, but towards the East at a completely perpendicular angle to the lights.  I don&apos;t think the jet&apos;s appearance was related, as I could tell it (the jet) was much, much closer that the lights.  What ever I was seeing had to be at an extremely high altitude, possibly in orbit or possibly in outer space.  I honestly don&apos;t know what I saw tonight but it just gave me the chills.  I thought, maybe it was two objects at first, but then I wondered, what! if it w as just one, extremely long object that was dimly illuminated at either end?  I&apos;ve seen a few weird things in my life, but nothing like this.  Please don&apos;t think I&apos;m crazy, I&apos;m usually pretty skeptical about these things, but to actually see it with my own eyes...  I don&apos;t know what else to say.  I can only hope that maybe there is some rational explanation for what I&apos;ve just seen."],

I saw towards the north and a circular object with red and greenish-blue lights was hovering from side to side smoothly but straight up within seconds. I quickly told others and we ruled out it could not possibly be any aircraft given the way it was moving! Another member came out and we were in awe! THe UFO then went south passing above us at a high altitude and we heard sound......I immediately called my brother withing city limits and he saw it too and at the exact moment it was above me, there was a sound on our phones!!!!!! The UFO continued to travel south towards Mexico until it faded away.  It was too bizarre.....we are still in shock.....  Then at about 3:02am, we are about to go inside, when we see what appears to be the same object this time going straight up hovering from the East side, but farther awa! y.  It moved acros the sky towards the northwest and faded!   My in-laws are Christians and could NOT believe what they also saw.   Unfortunately, we had no camera available at the time.((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.  PD))"],

        "description":["Fast Moving Dim light Filmed going Past Bright StarI was trying to see if I can see a Meator Shower and saw an dim light object coming at a fast speed 900 miles per hour. I pulled my Cellphone Camera out that was seeing to get a little light in background so it would show up on camera and luckilty it was past the the brightest star in the sky.  As I was unzooming my camera from the setting I had it on when the cellphone camera was in my hands I was using a Sony Ericsson C905a Cellphone Camera.  As I was filming it went past I said Here comes a Fast one.  Than I said It&apos;s coming faster this time. Than I said as I was unzooming I said Right Past this Star. Than I said It&apos;s going right past this star Right now. Than I said shouting there it is I got it on Camera.  Than said I got it. Than I said I got you on Camera boy.  Than I said hows it going dude. Than I said Yeah. Than I said in a studdering voice it got to be a UFO.  Than I said this is not than shockingly said ohhh a Meatorite just fell down that i wish I wou! ld of got that on camera. After that the camera shuts off after 47 seconds. I caught 27 seconds on film. The 20 seconds was me getting the camera out of zoom and waiting for it to come towards a better light source that big star in the sky. There was a some what alot of shacking in the camera footage while filming. The object was half the size of the star. The Star was 85 percent brighter than the object that was moving fast. The footage was taped at 4:52 AM. Footage is hard to see it but i have good contact lenses and can see good clearly. The Bad News is when I try to send this footage named MOV00025 to my email like I do with all my videos it says when I try to send the Cellphone is reading (Cannot add Video. Message will be to Large.) File Size is only 1.4MB and that should be able to send from my Cellphone to my Email.  The video is stored in my Phone Memory as MP4 just like all my other camera footage. Why is this too large when at 5 Am I am filming another one or the ! same one that is 2.7 MB and that one will send but not worth s! ending.Why is 1.4MB to large to send and 2.7MB is ok to send from Camera phone that don&apos;t make sense I think what I was filming sent me a Virus?  I have a AVS Editor I wanted to use to edit the cellphone camera footage file so I can gett a better view on my Windows XP Computer. The transfer file area does not work with the USB 2.0 plug my Cellphone came with the software for transfer says for windows XP says can&apos;t be added to this computer when uploaded the software my cellphone came with. Sending to Video DJ on Cellphone don&apos;t work  Either. Next try to send it to a memory Card once I order one if that will work.  Well anyways the ufo made no sound and over my head in a 360 direction past the sun over parents house as I was on the front sidewalk and saw it for almost 2 minutes until it was too far to see.  Than at 5 oclock it might of been back again it was about 6 blocks away coming back in the background in my back yard. I was flash the camera light at it trying to communicate with it.((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.  PD))"],

        "description":["Low flying lights manouvering over treeline.Went out to the lookout point east of runway 7 at Ingalls Field abandoned airport to watch the Perseid Meteor Shower at about midnight with a group of 6 people.  We saw several bright shooting stars before a brief rainshower passed through and everyone bugged out.  Took everyone home, and by the time everyone was home, it had cleared up again, so I decided to drive back up the mountain to see the peak by myself.  I arrived at about 3:30 AM, parked and set out in my chair behind my car with all lights off... about one or two per minute for at least an hour! Ink black sky, Milky way easily visible with the naked eye.  It was beautiful.  Then, I noticed something flashing through the trees to the east. It was a VERY brigh pure white light flashing so brightly it could be seen through the treeline, very low.  I waited for it to pass from behind the trees, and it raised in altitude and changed from a single white light brighter than any star in the sky to a row of 2-3 ! orange lights in a line, which seemed to pulsate or move left to right.  What scared me was the maneuverability.  This thing was flying &quot;S&quot; shaped patterns up and down over the treeline, estimated max altitude 2000 ft., apparent size as big as a pinky fingernail width at arms length.  It started flying in the same direction as the road I drove up to get to the lookout, and I got scared, so I instantly popped my trunk, folded my chair and threw it in as fast as aI could and hit the &quot;unlock&quot; button on my car. As soon as the car unlocked, all the car lights went on, and I thought &quot;SH*T&quot;!  I looked up, and the three orange lights became one much brighter orange light, almost looked like it was shining something at me, like it saw me.  I instantly hopped in my car, cranked it and tried to run in a panic... the car cranked very very slowly for a few seconds, and the lights dimmed before it started up and I drove away. I was scared because I had to drive in the direction of the thing to get out of there so I floored it very fast, narrowly missing a deer.Looked up, and at one second could see the thing through my winshield, which scared me even more. I didn;t feel safe until the road went under the dense tree canopy. There was no noise at all, and no contrails. All I can say is, never again by myself.  Been up there several times to look at stars with people, and we often see solid lights at high altitude on ballistic trajectories, probably satellites, but this was low and bright, and abnormal.  Don;t know what it was, but never again by myself at that hour.."],

        "description":["Black Triangle/Pyramid shape craft flew across lake and directly over our carOn Aug 12, 2010, I went out about 2:30 am to watch the Perseids meteor shower.I was by Milton 3 Ponds in Milton, NH, I was looking at the bottom Right star in the little dipper, when I saw a extremely bright flash at first I thought I saw a star burn out, when my eyes  adjusted I noticed that the star was still there but now it was moving from left to right.My next thought was well it is just a satellite or maybe the space station, just then it stopped, It stayed stationary for about 5-6 seconds and then it started moving again but in a different direction, it now was heading toward the lake it made a large ark out and around the lake and right back to the place where I first spotted it.The next night Aug 13, 2010, my neighbor that I told what I had seen the night before ask me If I would go back to the lake and take him this time, and I did, well we were not there 10 minutes when the same object appeared again roughly in the same spot I had seen it the night before. About 5-6 minutes later my friend pointed out a really bright light in the western sky just above the tree line, we watched this bright light for a good half an hour, during this time we watched this light change from red to green to blue and also white.This light also would appear to just blink out completely for 3-4 seconds and then appear again but several feet in the sky to its left and our right, it also looked like it was moving up and down left and right and even at times in small circles this light disappeared 5 times 4 of the 5 it would re-appear but each time it came back it was a little more to its left, the 5th time it went out it did not come back.We had no clue what we were looking at and jokingly I said to my friend what would you do if it disappeared and all of a sudden it was right above us, as I finished saying that I kind of jumped and said holly shit that just scared the shit out of me, my friend quickly looked in my direction and said what?, and I replied oh that plane coming across the lake with its landing lights on, we kind of laughed but kept watching the plane, as it got closer it started looking more and more not like a plane,  My friend asked is there an airport close by and I said no why?  And he said then why would it be so low and have its landing lights on?  Well this got us both really watching these 2 lights that I thought at first was a plane with its landing lights on, it was getting closer and we still didn`t hear any noise.As it got closer we could see it better it had 2 large flood lights in the front but we didn`t see the standard red and green blinking lights on the wings, and still didn`t hear any sound from it we were sitting in the car with the sunroof open, and the craft was coming right at us from my left across the lake. It flew just about right over us, as it got right above us it was about 3-400 feet up and it flew through a small cloud as it got right above us that was when we heard a very low like rumbling sound nothing like a plane at all, but when it entered the cloud those huge spot lights in the front lit up the whole cloud and it illuminated the whole craft in like a golden aura, that was when the 2 of us really got a good look at it and I can say it scared the hell out of us both!! It looked like a large triangle, the first thing my friend said was holy shit look at that it looks like a pyramid flying over us!! It had the 2 large lights in the front and one large strobe in t! he back there were no other standard lights at all on this thing! what I saw was what looked like a pyramid sitting on top of this black triangle I also saw well the only way I can describe it as a half of an arch going from half way from the rear point of the triangle from the front arching up to this pyramid shape that was on top of the triangle.On the inside of this arch looking part on the pyramid part it looked like either a row of six windows that were illuminated from inside with a golden light or maybe it was just a row of 6 golden lights. It wasn`t moving very fast at all, maybe like 40-50 MPH because we got a good look, as it went over us for I would say maybe 4-5 seconds. On the right side of the road, is a row of pine trees as it went over these trees, I jumped out of the car and ran to the other side of the road just past the row of trees is a swampy area roughly a quarter of a mile across then you hit the rest of the woods.It looked to us like it had dropped even lower when it passed the first row of trees to where I thought it was either going to land or crash into this swampy area, but when I got to the tree line I could see this thing start to move back up and over the wooded area on the other side of the swamp, and it  seemed to just blink out of sight.I have never seen anything like this in my life, and I have seen a lot of different aircraft, I am a Navy vet that served during the Gulf war.I have been trying to draw what I saw but I am not a very good artist, after we got back in the car I realized my new cell phone had a camera and does take video I am really kicking myself in the butt for not thinking of using the phone to either video it or at least get a few snap shots of this thing!"],

        "description":["3 swift moving dark eye-shaped attached segments of shimmering grey/silver fly abreast smoothly change to single file  nnw to won the evening of august 13, 2010, i was outside observing the sky for the perseid  meteor shower.  i watched as the moon, venus, mars and saturn set in the west.  i observed satellites, commercial and private aircraft, as well as a few meteors.  at the time of this sighting, jupiter was just below the tree line in the east. i have been studying astronomy and the night sky for 20 years.   i know the difference between many of the things people think are ufos, and an actuall unexplainable object in the sky.what i saw friday the 13th, at about 10:25 pm was not explainable. i saw the whole incident through binoculars, with a momentary naked eye glance to verify.the object was in three segments or parts, but they all moved as if they were attached to each other.  they were a smokey grey/silver.  the edges were undefined.  each segment was shaped like an human eye--a tapered oval.  it was not lit but seemed to be either softly reflecting light or softly glowing from the center of each segment.  the center of each segment was lighter or brighter than the darker, undefined outer edges.when i first saw it, the parts were traveling abreast in a westerly direction, and then they manuvered to single file one after the other. they did not turn in any other direction, they just went smoothly from traveling abreast to traveling single file.  the largest segment was closest to me, and stayed in front.  the smallest segment was the center one. the last and farthest segment was sized almost as large as the first.  while changing formation, it did not change traveling direction.  it flew from northeast close to east of where the north star is, and went west just over the handle of the big dipper, on towards arcturus, where i lost it behind some trees.  after losing sight of it, i looked at the time, it was 10:26 pm.comparison--if you have ever seen the andromeda galaxy on a dark clear night--in binoculars, this is what each segment looked like--except darker undefined edges and of course it was moving.  each segment was roughtly the same size as the andromeda galaxy.    the formation took up the space that the plaeides constellation takes up in a binocular view.  although my binoculars are not high quality, they afford me a nice view of the night sky, i can make out the beehive cluster with them, but not something like the rings of saturn or the moons of jupiter.  the binoculars are 12x50, probably better for birding, but they do the job on a nice clear night.the weather was very clear, no clouds, about 72 degree f.  the sky was dark enough in my backyard to see the andromeda galaxy this night (i saw it later that evening).the stars were so clear that it was easy to see anything moving against the starfield, which is why i saw this object.i was facing due north, i has been following 2 satellites which paths had seemed to come quite close together in the northeast.  after they separated, the one i ended up following had faded in the north. this was when i picked up this object moving swiftly through the sky.  it was about 35 degrees off my zenith, traveling west.  it took maybe 10-15 seconds at the most (?) for it to be gone from my view.with north as 12 oclock, it traveled from 1 oclock towards my left (west) past 12, 11, 10 oclock, to about 9 oclock.   it appeared to be in space with the satellites, not close to where conventional aircraft fly.  the speed of travel was much faster than an airliner at 20,000 feet at 5 miles away, faster than any satellite  i have seen cross the sky, but slower than a shooting star crossing my field of view. as i watched, it went behind some treetops momentarily--and i still had no trouble following it.  there was no trail of smoke or exhaust.  all three segments seemed to shimmer or vibrate gently.  the shimmering was more perceptable at the edges of each segment.i have seen geese fly in the moonlight, and this was almost the same, but there were no wings flapping, no honking, no bird shape (no long neck, nothing moving on any segment) and the objects maintained a constant distance from one another like they were firmly attached even when changing formation. there was no attaching structure that i could see, i do not remember seeing stars &apos;through&apos; or &apos;between&apos; the segments, althogh if i had, i would have noticed.at this point the crescent moon had set, i suspect that this object was high enough to gather ambient light enough from the same source as our satellites (the sun), and reflect it back. it could have been picking up the glow of the moon below the horizon, or ambient city light glow.   the sight of it also gave me the impression that somehow it was absorbing most of the light, like it was cloaked.  my only other thought on what this was like would be an airplane flying with no lights at all.  it still does not explain the shape of the object, or the apparent formation change during flight.there was no sound, no smell, no vibrations, no strange feelings during this sighting.  i live approximately 6 minutes by commercial air travel from newark airport (25 miles or so by car) and wonder if anything showed on radar (if this thing was low enough).   becouse i am an experienced sky observer, i believe that this is indeed a ufo, unless there are man made crafts that can appear as i have described.  when i first saw this object, i remembered to be as observant as possible and kept in mind real life comparisons for a good description. i have searched the internet for descriptions or videos that are similar.  when i find something i will be in touch.  i am only sorry i did not have my hd camcorder ready, although i am not sure this would have shown up in video without more hi-tech equipment.  i get annoyed at some of the ufo reports that lack in detail, or have poor descriptions. and i want to be as detailed as possible.to demonstrated my observational skills and knowlege: previously, i have seen many things that seemed unexplainable in the night sky.  i came to no conclusions until i thought through what i had seen.  there was a reasonble explanation, no matter how fantastic it seemed at the time.   two of these previous sightings are as follows:  one object i had seen was a very bright round falling object in the southeastern sky in mid october. a peice of it had also fallen away below it like molten silver, i watched it fade after about 5 minutes. it made no noise although it looked like it would hiss like a fire if you could hear it.   it was either a shooting star coming directly at me that broke up into two peices, or a rocket booster falling away after lauch. this occured around 3 am and i was too tired to look it up, but i am sure that is what it was.the other object was a very distant, large bright green flair in a cold winter northeastern sky, a green so brilliant, like the the color green a diamond reflects in the sunlight.  this flair left a trail and it traveled in horizontal fashion, taking much longer than fireworks to fade. there was no sound. this was probably a military flare from a marine vessel (i live close to the waters west of new york city and staten island--close enough to observe a flare from the water there if it was shot high enough).the exact dates of these occurences have long been forgotten, because i knew they were easily explained.  at the time, they were surprising and amazing to see.i am an expereinced amateur sky watcher.  i would like to point out that i know the difference between the most obscure explanaions for identifiable objects, and an unidentified flying object.  i have seen almost every kind of non-ufo expample in the day and night sky -- so i do know the difference.  i hope there is some logical explanation for this.  i have never seen anything like this before.ok for preliminary email contact by nuforc investigator.  thanks."],

Tonight as I was watching this craft another craft flew directly over my apartment to high to make out the size.  I live near the airport so I am familiar of airplanes and this was not an airplane.  This craft was v shaped with red lights on the bottom.   It looked like it was at the height of a plane but made no sound, I watched to see if it descended to the airport which it did not.

        "description":["@ the intersection of Priness Anne Road &amp; Upton Drive, near Red Mill Commons...A buddy and I were heading home from grabbing a bite to eat when we stopped at a traffic light and saw three lights moving in one direction. My friend asked if I noticed that the far left light was behaving oddly; it wasn&rsquo;t flashing, but it would seemingly disappear from view at random intervals. I thought it looked like a plane, at first, but the light positions and behavior didn&rsquo;t correspond with those of typical navigation lights.  Right before the light turned green, the object seemed to stop.  I was close enough to the ground to use terrestrial objects as a reference for its position.  We then began travelling towards the object on a two lane highway, leading out to the rural part of town (I gather from the way it approached that this was where it was originally, before moving towards us).  The closer we got to it, the more we realized that it had stopped moving and was hovering over a field. It was frozen in place.  The radio was at a very minimal volume and we both had our windows down.  We were more than close enough to hear a jet turbine, prop chatter, etc. At our closest point I would imagine it was roughly 125 yards out in the field.The craft was triangular in shape, but somewhat thin from a side view.  It had three lights, one on each corner of the triangle shape, and a spotlight on the front (or in the direction was moving, rather), which was casting a fading cone shape, straight ahead.  For a brief period, I also noticed a faint blue light emanating from underneath the vessel. We pulled over in a turning lane just beyond our point of perp endicularity.  As we stopped, the car behind us pulled over in the same turning lane, just ahead of us. My friend got out of the car to catch a better look, but my view was perfect from inside the car.  Shortly after stopping, the craft began floating across the road we were travelling, not quite a quarter mile behind us.  It was directly above the street; I would wager it was about 150-200 feet above the ground.  It was travelling very slow and was heading behind the shopping center we had just left. We pulled up next to the other car and asked the driver if he saw what j! ust happened. He said he just got off the phone with his girlfriend, telling her about the hovering object.  He claimed he was a seasoned pilot and began commenting on the object&apos;s triangular shape and strange hovering.  He explained how the particular craft looked and behaved unlike anything he had ever seen.Side note:  This is a tough position to be in.  I used to mock those that reported UFOs, but now, I am one of them.  My friend and I, plus the other man in the car behind us, saw something that was simply unfathomable.  This was no faded smudge from a distance or a lightning fast stream of light; this was up close and personal."],

        "description":["It was 8:34PM and already pitch black outside.  Out of the corner of my eye, I could see the plane lights wavering behind the tree&apos;s as the aircraft approached. I had assumed that it was a plane anyways.  I sat at the glass door for a moment, watching the lights approach as I usually did- out of habit more than anything.As the seconds passed, I noticed that the aircraft seemed to be rising forward into the air at an accelerating velocity- one that seemed almost unusually fast.  I continued to watch in curiosity.  In less than a second, the aircraft made a 390 degree turn, a full circle and then off to the right. There was no way it could be a plane, so I ran outside to see it better.As it flew above the tree-line, I noticed that the lights didn&apos;t look anything like the ones on a plane and the shape of the vehicle was extremely unusual.  The lights were not sharp and pronounced, but instead were hazy and burned like fire, scattered about the bottom and sides of the UFO. They were pale yellow to bluish-green in color and seemed to be linked by thinner lines of light.The UFO itself was not a sleek thin design like I might have imagined it to be.  The main body appeared dark grey and semi-metallic (it reminded me of silicon) and pyramidal, but had abstract shaped parts attached to the main body, creating a shape that is nearly indiscernible to describe from such a short observation period.It continued off to the right for a moment before all of the lights on the aircraft immediately shut off.  I could still see the body due to light pollution and a faint glow that seemed to radiate from the UFO, preventing it from becoming completely hidden.  It changed course in a matter of milliseconds and accelerated again in a sharp upward direction before it was out of eyesight.I watched for a little longer and saw something that made me almost laugh in awe.  What I could see to be as several military fighter jets came into my sight only moments later, uniformly chasing in the same direction I had seen the unidentified aircraft travel before disappearing.  They, I noticed, travelled at a speed and in a manner that I had expected human constructed planes to fly.  And they were far behind."],

I had stepped off the elevator to drop paperwork off went back to elevator within a minute and the object was gone.  I knew it wasn&apos;t a plane, or a helicopter, or a goodyear blimp.  I&apos;m not sure what it was but I do know it was round because of the distance it appeared to be black.  The building I work in has three elevators, I was in the middle one.  The elevators have glass all around when I look out I could see the Secaucus area, the turnpike, further down open space with a view of the road and other cities.  It took place at exactly 2:15pm. Unfortunately, I didn&apos;t have my cell phone on me to take a picture of what I was seeing."],

        "description":["Slow-moving, glowing white/orange ballMy friend and I were driving East towards Tecumseh, just outside Topeka, to watch the Perseid meteor shower when we saw a bright white light that sort of had an orange glow ahead of us.  It was about twice the size of Venus (as it appears during this time of year).  At first I thought maybe it was an abnormally bright light on top of a radio tower or that it was Venus but since it was larger, brighter and had a steady glow, I started to think maybe it was a plane or helicopter falling from the sky...  It looked like a ball of fire and it moved at a slow, steady speed downwards toward the horizon (I stopped my car for a moment to make sure it was actually moving).  Then it gradually started to move diagonally towards the north, then almost completely parallel to the horizon and then down until I could no longer see it because of trees on the horizon.While I have no idea how large it was or how far away it was, it was about 40 degrees from the eastern horizon when we first saw it.  It also had a steady glow, didn&apos;t twinkle or fade out or anything.  Just stayed a constant brightness comparable to Venus&apos;s but white with a slightly orange outline and an almost burning appearance (which might not make it a steady glow... but it didn&apos;t flicker or anything.  It just seemed to &quot;boil&quot; slightly as a ball engulfed in flames would).I considered the idea that it could be something someone had shot into the air, like some sort of firework that came falling to the ground but it appeared to be very far away and thus would be quite large (I&apos;m not sure if you can really measure the distance of something with no idea what the object is... or how large it is... so this guess is based on the fact that the trees in the horizon were probably a mile away or so)."],

        "description":["A glowing yellow ball from the distance that was a &quot;single headlight&quot; for a triangular shaped craft.On August 12, 2010, my sister (a 20-year-old 3rd year university student), her boyfriend (a 22-year-old security guard), and I (a 26-year-old elementary school teacher with a master&apos;s degree) planned to watch the meteor showers at my house in Berlin Township, MI.  At about 10:30, we all laid on the deck and were enjoying the clear skies, stars, and a few meteors.Shortly after 11, my sister&rsquo;s boyfriend pointed out a very bright glow (appeared golf ball sized) to the east.  We all sat up to look, at first thinking it was a meteor.  The light appeared to be getting closer.  After 30 seconds or so, we knew it wasn&rsquo;t a meteor because we could see the light was coming from some type of aircraft.  It appeared to be a headlight, the beam went out into the night sky like a flashlight.  It was NOT a spotlight&mdash;it did not shine down.  The craft continued to move forward, it was moving west.  On one side of the craft was a small blue light and on the other side a small red light, similar to airplanes.  As the craft moved overhead we could see it was triangular shaped and was close, not so close where we&rsquo;d be alarmed but closer than airplanes normally fly.  We watched as the craft very quietly moved west , dipped and glided toward the north, dipped down and up a few more times, and was finally out of view.We were all stunned at what we saw and returned to the deck to continue watching for meteors.  Less than 5 minutes later from the same point in the sky, the bright yellow circular glow appeared again.  We witnessed the same thing again with the same (if not very similar) flight pattern.  This time we all heard what we describe as a &quot;whirring&quot; noise.  After this one was out of view we began to walk from the front yard to the back yard again when we immediately saw another one of the exact same appearance.  This led us to believe there were minimally 2 separate crafts since our 2nd sighting had vanished only seconds earlier.My sister&rsquo;s boyfriend left at 11:40 p.m..  My sister and I drove south down Dixie Highway for about 5 minutes in an attempt to find better views.  As we turned around and headed back, we had our 4th sighting.My sister&rsquo;s boyfriend called shortly after midnight (8/13/10) to say he was outside of his home in Trenton, MI, and was witnessing the same yellow glow.  However, this time the glow hovered at a farther distance for several minutes.  It did not move overhead to reveal the triangular shaped aircraft, but instead simply hovered.My sister and I stayed outside until approximately 2:00 a.m. (8/13/10) and saw a few more meteors but did not have another sighting of the aircraft.  We emailed our local channel 4 news to see if anyone else reported a sighting or if there was an possibility of some type of military practice.  We haven&rsquo;t heard anything back and have not found any other reports online."],

The UFO also has 2 bright white strobe lights down the middle of the triangle at opposing ends.On Wednesday at about 1am,  August 11,  2010, I was getting out of my truck at work and quickly glanced at an aircraft flying overhead at a low altitude from the south heading toward the north.  At first, I thought that it was a commercial jet, yet as I took a moment to focus my gaze, I realized that there was something unusual about it.   I see commercial jets and helicopters flying over head at times, but I didn&rsquo;t hear any sound from this flying object and that the lights displayed didn&rsquo;t fit the description of a plane or helicopter that I&rsquo;ve seen before.  The UFO travelled at a steady pace similar to a commercial jet until it faded in the distance.  I witnessed this UFO cross overhead from the south heading toward the north for about 10 seconds until it was out of my sight.  I would say that looking north, the UFO was heading north with a slight 10-20 degrees toward the northwest.Other than witnessing the UFO, I did notice a helicopter passing overhead shortly before this sighting.  As I witnessed the UFO, the helicopter appeared further north and from the west.   It stopped in the direction the UFO was heading.  The UFO continued north past the helicopter out of my sight while the helicopter slowly followed it until it too was out of my sight.My Background:  A happily married male in mid twenties.

It was white light like a bunch of stars linked together to form a line about an inch wide from my perspective.  And it tilted down to the right a bit.I was thinking how it couldn&rsquo;t be a plane or anything like that because those are usually one dot and slowly moving.  This was like if an edge of a coin were lit up in a line and it wasn&rsquo;t really moving.Then it slowly tilted with purpose (again this was strange to me because if it were a man made prop or something far away the effort to so even would be quite difficult) like when you weigh something with those doctor scales and you get the lead weight right it kind of has this slow settling into place as it gets its balance.  Like that. It tilted in that &lsquo;gaining balance&rsquo; way for another 20 degrees tilting down on the right side.Suddenly it looked like it was moving forward away from me for a moment and then I got this sense of a burst of incredible speed because the lights became smaller so quick they practically winked out they were gone so fast.I was not tired. I was not drunk.  I have never made such a claim before.  I saw my first UFO.  I have no idea what it was alien, military, or otherwise but Unidentified Flying Object.  Oh yes."],

Each one moving in their own directions but rejoining each other. Last I saw, they were all lined up, miles off the coast and one by one the lights went out.

        "description":["Me and a friend routinely go to Chestnut Ridge Park near Cooper&apos;s Rock State Forest to get a clear view of the night sky.  I have a pair of fairly high powered binoculars that I keep in my car at all times.  We have witnessed several obvious disks wobbling/zigzagging through the sky on multiple occasions in this area, but never anything like what we witnessed on this night.It was a very dark and moonless night.  I was scanning the treeline with my binoculars while my friend observed with his eyes.  Through my binoculars I noticed a cluster of several hexagonal yellow lights. This was not a constellation, or any star formation.  It immediately stunned me because I am very familiar with the area as I go there all the time, it is one of the best places to see the sky clearly close to Morgantown.  I got my friend&apos;s attention and observed it with my naked eye. It was a large, quarter size at arm&apos;s length, cluster of hexagonal lights blinking on and off.   We could not tell for sure if this was several objects hovering together, or lights on a larger craft, but it did appear that it was a singular craft as we were both able, through binoculars, to see smaller objects flying around the craft.  Both of us felt frightened by what we saw.   We observed the object for about 25 minutes. It never moved suddenly or swiftly but it did appear to be getting smaller and! farther away as the sighting went on.   Eventually, we left as it was getting late.  The object was still observable when we headed home.I do want to remain totally anonymous, as I never report the objects we witness in that area, but I decided to submit this account because it was an especially startling sighting and unlike anything I or my friend had seen before.  I believe that one only has to seek these things out in order to witness them, because this kind of activity seems to be happening all the time.((NUFORC Note:  Source  elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.

It looked to be flying around 10,000ft or so, not super high, but just high enough for me to not get a good look at it. Was very quiet.It was in level flight, straight line coming from the direction of roughly west-south-west and flying east-north-east.It got my attention because it had a light brigher that a normal aircraft and was coming my way. The light was a off-white color, almost yellowish.  There were NO blinking lights on the craft like you would normally see on a normal aircraft.  After it flew by, I could still see the bright light, but then I could make out 3 white lights in the rear.  It was too dark to see the shape of the craft.  Did I mention it was very quiet?  Normally a craft flying overhead, you can see the blinking lights, and normally at that altitude you can hear the jet engines.  I did not.  All lights were an off-white to yellowish color, and I could not hear the engines.  Looked to be traveling at normal speeds of a jet craft. Maybe 400-500mph.People up near the Wisconsin border or even Kenosha may have seen it too if it kept going that direction.((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.

Within about 10 seconds after i noticed the object, it completely disappeared.  I told this to my fiance, and he looked at me like a had two heads. We went over to a friends house which was about 10 miles away from mine.  I decided not to say anything in case i had the same reaction i got from my fiance.  As we we&apos;re getting out of the car, my friend says, &quot;You will never believe what i just saw.&quot; Our stories were way to similar to be a coincidence.

I have often witnessed satellites smoothly moving across the night skies, looking like the stars, but just moving quietly, quickly and smoothly.  Tonight, though, I witnessed two very distinct but small white lights moving across the sky from south to north, straight across the sky, more quickly than I&rsquo;ve seen anything, other than the &quot;shooting stars,&quot; but nearly at that speed.  They moved in a completely straight line, in a directly northerly direction.  They were next to each other, but in a formation where one was slightly in front of the other.  That&rsquo;s it.

I noticed the light because of its color, and the fact that it appeared to be at a low altitude, lower than planes would occupy, and it seemed to be hovering over the area.When I reached my home, about a minute and a half later, and looked in the direction of the light, it was still there, but seemed to be moving slowly.  My husband and I watched the light for several minutes as it seemed to drift away from us.  Before it disappeared from view, another light appeared from the same direction as the first one, and behaved in the same manner.  Before it too, drifted away, a third light appeared, again from the same direction.  There were three red-orange lights total.  All were at a low altitude, and all seemed to hover or move very slowly before simply vanishing.he night sky was clear last night so we are unsure how the lights simply disappeared from sight.My husband, nephew and I witnessed the lights.

I pulled over to watch them and videoed for 20 minutes.  While videoing them, they didn&apos;t appear to be moving.  After review of the video, they were indeed moving slowly, noticed by a point of reference in the video.I thought possibly it was a bright star or planet (even though I have never seen a star or planet this bright), so I rushed home to grab my camera and tripod.  I was going to attempt to do a long exposure photograph that would capture the star trails as the earth spun to see if these lights were of the same pattern.  As I went back out to the vicinity of the lights, I noticed they were much farther away.  They were moving in a west / south-west direction.  I attempted to get on the interstate to follow them (I-16 west), but they were moving too fast for me to keep up and eventually I lost them in the trees in the western sky."],

        "description":["40+ fireballs in formation moving fast and changing shapesThe sighting happened at 21:38 on Monday, August 9th 2010.  I was located in Spokane Valley, WA and, I was looking directly above me when my sighting took place and the angle of elevation was 90 degrees.  I witnessed approximately 40 or more brightly lit objects/orbs of orange and reddish light in a formation/straight line above me moving east very quickly.  The objects themselves were in motion as they maintained the line formation, and they appeared to move in front of each other and around each other.  Formation then changed shape from a line to a V.  Objects appeared to be the same size as the stars and appeared to be at a high altitude based on my observations.A closed fist at arm&rsquo;s length when the formation/cluster was directly above me covered about 1/10th of the formation.  The cluster of objects was very large across the sky.  No other witnesses were present at time of sighting, and objects made no noise whatsoever as they went overhead from west to east.  Objects then changed shape into a V formation, and then disappeared from view to the east after about ten seconds.  Speed of objects was very fast, covering the sky and off to the east in seconds.  Speed of the objects was constant the whole time.  It was almost hard to follow them because of the speed.  I have been an amateur meteorologist for about 15 years and I watch the sky daily and observe weather conditions and aircraft all the time from my residence.  I can say with much certainty that the objects I witnessed were not any known aircraft, stars or planets.  This was in the lower atmosphere and seemed very unusual to me.  I have never witnessed anything like this, an! d I would love to find out more on what this may have been.  Feel free to contact me for any more info.  Thanks"],

The lights were very bright and white; we could not make out any details of a plan, ships etc&hellip;  My sister handed me the digital camera (we had been taking underwater pictures in the pool, so we had the camera with us) and we took four pictures.

I have observed that there is a cell tower in that vicinity, however the light that I saw appeared to be acting more similarly to the light of a lighthouse than the on/off blink of these towers.  The light changed from a large red to a smaller, dimmer yellowish amber - similar to that of stars.  And then it appeared to fly off.   At first I suspected a helicopter, however I could hear no sound and the rate of travel was inconsistent with my expectations, thus this posting.I have noticed something similar this evening, appearing this time in the south west sky and appearing to be much further away than what I observed last night.

I told him the neighbors were setting off fireworks over the lake. He said no. It&rsquo;s not fireworks.  I walked out and saw the object in the air and was trying to come up with an answer for this.  A balloon, Blimp but as it got closer I saw a distinctive triangle with different colored lights. Red, Blue Yellow, and a little green.  But as it got closer I noticed that it was not only the triangle that the lights were lit.  But tiny little lines, not many but definitive lines of dimmer lights that were in the middle of the triangle. I called my wife to see and to get the camera.  We started to take pictures of the craft. And soon as the flashes of the camera were going off it seemed to move slowly in the opposite direction  north northeast.  Then went slowly upward into the clouds and now just blue lights were showing through the clouds.  I can send the pictures if requested.

Apprx. one minute to traverse the sky.On Saturday evening 8/7/2010 at 2135 hours, my friend and were seated on an outdoor patio in the Detroit area and witnessed an object of indeterminate shape rising from the SW or SSW treeline. The object was a very bright orange-yellow and I at first thought it might have been an aircraft with its landing lights on.  Its magnitude was far brighter than Sirius.  It is difficult to gauge the size of the object but I would estimate it as subtending half the angle as does a light plane at very high altitude. From our vantage point, looking in a NNW direction, the object was at about 45 degrees from the horizon. We heard no sound, saw no trail and watched it trace an arc for about one minute before it dipped below the trees in the NE or NNE. It appeared to have maintained the same level of brightness throughout its trajectory, ruling out any &quot;landing lights&quot;.   At the time I speculated that it could have been a space vehicle during re-entry.  The object seemed far to! o bright to have been reflecting sunlight and the time was 50 minutes past sunset.I called Selfridge ANG base and spoke with a colonel in the Air Museum but he could provide no information; they had no reports of a sighting. I checked the Space Shuttle schedule and ruled out that possibility.  I then contacted our local TV stations and had the same result.  I spoke with our TV weatherman, who seemed very interested but he also had no reports of any such phenomenon.  He checked on the wind direction for the time of the object&apos;s transit but the high altitude winds were in a direction almost opposite that which would account for a weather balloon as an explanation."],

        "description":["round object with much smaller attached object circling the main object in vertical motionI am a casual amateur astronomer with some working knowledge of the night sky.  I had just begun an evening of stargazing in rural southern Ohio and was planning to start with sightings of Venus, Saturn, and Mars, which were grouped quite close together just after sunset on 8-7-10.  I noticed the object in question while waiting for Venus to appear after sunset.  In terms of brightness it looked a lot like Venus, but it was way too high in the sky to be that planet, and its brightness was probably closer to that of Jupiter, which was not due to appear until much later in the evening.  I thought perhaps it was a very bright star but did not know what star it might be.To attempt to identify the object, I trained my 6-inch Dobsonian with low magnification on the object.  What I saw was a disc, but not a disc in the sense of a flying saucer type object seen edge-on.  Rather, it was perfectly round and about the size of Jupiter on high magnification.  It appeared to have some markings on it somewhat similar to the light and dark areas seen on Mars when that planet is relatively close to Earth.  It did not appear to be moving at all.As I observed the object, I noticed it had a much smaller object which appeared to be circling it, much as you might see the Galilean moons orbiting Jupiter.  But the circling was not horizontal like a natural satellite --- east-west or west-east --- but rather a vertical polar orbit.  As I watched, the smaller object moved from about the 7:00 o&apos;clock position on the main object up to the very top 12:00 o&apos;clock position.  What was even weirder was that the smaller object appeared to be attached to the main object by a line which was very thin but quite visible.All of this happened very quickly, in a matter of a few seconds, and after this brief observation I was mystified as to what the object might be.  I thought perhaps it might be some exotic satellite of which I was unaware.  I took my eye from the telescope so I could just look at it to see if it was moving across the sky in a straight line at a steady rate with a steady brightness the way satellites do.  But when I looked up it had vanished.  Satellites wink out when they enter the earth&apos;s shadow and are no longer illuminated by the sun.  But as far as I could tell this object was not moving at all.  Had it been moving I would have almost certainly noticed some movement of the main object when I was looking at it through the telescope, since magnification also magnifies the perceived motion of an object across the sky. I have never seen anything like this and I am at a loss as to what this object might have been.  I was sober with my faculties intact when I observed it. {:&gt;) If anyone has seen something similar or knows what it may have been I would be interested in some feedback."],

I am wondering if there are any others in the area that have seen or reported the same things.I would like it if my old friend Peter Davenport would call me and i could tell him the details directly.I used to be a Field Investigator and State Section Director for York County Maine MUFON.My interest in this field is because i have been having unusual forms of contact all my life and still have sightings occasionally.  I know what to look for and this was no doubt, the real thing.... i have 2 witnesses this time...not always been the case....:) Hope to hear from Peter, it has been awhile...BTW, he loved my Investigative reports...he will remember me...i also met him twice while visiting Seattle, about 8 years ago.Thank you, ((name deleted)) Sundays is a good time to call me at work: 207-((number deleted)) (Name of business deleted)), Portland, ME.)"],

I stopped and observed the object moving 300 to 400 mph in this Northerly direction. I listened for the engine noise thinking it was a jet with the afterburner burning. There was absolutely no engine noise.At this time I saw a second bright orange orb at a distance behind the first estimated at one mile. At this point I went inside and called my wife to come outside and look at what I was seeing and grabbed my camera. Then a third came up toward the second and so on, until there were 10 to 12 objects passing in single file above the horizon, climbing in altitude and all moving at a steady rate.This went on for a total of 15 minutes. It was mostly cloudy at the time we observed the objects, except where we able to see the objects appear. All disappeared into the clouds at the far North, estimated to be ten to fifteen miles.At no time was there any engine noise and all of the objects had the same orange color and dimensions. All were round, bright orange, about the color of a fresh pumpkin.

At 3:20 pm I purchased ice cream for my daughter at the Glen Echo Caf&eacute; and then after walking around, maybe for 10 minutes we sat at a park bench facing the main building area.  My son was with me as well.I looked up at the sky and saw something that appeared round remaining in the same spot.  It was high above the clouds.  I heard a helicopter near by and also saw a plane.  I looked again to see if it was a helicopter but realized that it was too high for me to hear any sound from it.  I remained seated with my kids but chatted with them taking my eyes off what I had seen.After a few minutes I thought I would take another look and sure enough it was in the same spot.  Not knowing what it was-it did look like an unusual speck-I grabbed my camera and took a picture of the sky where I saw it thinking I just might be able to magnify the picture and see it better later at home.  Three minutes later, I zoomed in and took another picture.  I also did a short video clip with a description of what we were looking at.My children did not see it at first but I brought it to their attention by directing them to look in an area in between and above two red turrets and then to follow up the sky to the last cloud.  They did locate it at that point.  I would have to say we were there for at least 10 minutes and it had remained in the same place.When I got home, I was convinced I got nothing but then when I pulled up the picture, I located the spot in the picture and with interest magnified it.  It turned out to be what looked like a metallic sphere reflecting the sun.I am sending a Google Earth picture of the area showing exactly where we were sitting.  I am also including the clearest snap shot with magnification.  On the original picture with the cloud, you cannot see the spot too easily but once you locate it and magnify it, you can view the sphere.The best way to find it is to look at the cloud, move your eyes to the part on the bottom that resembles the map of Italy.  From there look to the right and once you reach the far right side of the cloud, you will see a tiny dot-don&rsquo;t ask me why I even noticed it on such a bright day.I have no idea what it was-a weather balloon?-but as shown by the pictures I took, it had not moved in the space of three minutes.  I just wonder if any one else in our area saw this thing."],

After about 20 minutes the flickering light rose above tree line into a clearing and there it appeared more like a super bright white star. The light floated side to side up and down and gradually worked more southern but worked a range north to south while gradually fading west.  It was visible for at least an hour.  Sometimes moving down and disapearing for 5 minute and then returning.  During the last 10 minutes of watching, a second bright star like floating object jetted toward the original and then quickly shot north west like a shooting star in speed.  The original object was slow and bounced in the sky much like someone moving a flashlight across a ceiling.We checked for reflections. The window was open on our home and there were no reflections. There was no noise and the sky was clear. Normal star patterns were seen in the sky that were not moving. The object was not moving fast enough to be helicopter nor airplane.  We watched from the blackness of our open bedroom window until the object seemed to fade away.The object was star like in appearance but brighter and resembled a bright white round ball that had occasional bright white beams flickering like a super shiney flickering diamond.

        "description":["Silver disk flew over my backyard, directly overhead, low and slow.On the afternoon of August 6, 2010, I was on a lounge chair in my backyard on the north side of the swimming pool. It was 2:40 pm on a sunny day with a mostly blue sky dotted with a few puffy clouds.  I was facing east and was in the shade cast by the tall bamboo behind me.  Although there was no change in the light, I had a random thought that dark thunderclouds might be coming in from the west and looked up at the sky.  A few seconds later I saw a silver disk travelling from west to east, in a straight line over my pool almost directly overhead.At first glance I thought it was some kid&apos;s silver balloon that got loose but quickly realized it was no floppy, tinfoil balloon, but some kind of solid, firm-surfaced metal. I focused in on it so I could remember as much detail as possible. It was shaped like a disk but also had a squashed circle/egg type shape. The top and bottom were rounded and the sides were slightly rounded, like the shape of a Mento candy. There were no hard edges or seams, no puckers or variations of color or texture in the surface. It was totally smooth and reflective, the bottom of it turning darker as it passed over the green trees at the eastern end of the yard. I&apos;m estimating that it was about 30 feet above the fully mature maple trees, so maybe 60 feet above ground. I got the impression that it might be 3 to 4 feet in diameter. Although it was breezy at the treetops, the disk moved in a straight line, with no side to side wavering or drifting from the wind, and no change in altitude. There! was absolutely no sound emitting from it.After the disk had been in my sight for about 5 seconds I had the presence of mind to call out, &quot;Look up!&quot; to my husband, who was doing some yard work about 20 feet behind me and to the right. Since he was to the right of the edge of the bamboo stand he had a clear view of the disk and looked up in time to see it just as it was going over the trees. His description of the disk corroborated mine. From the time I saw the disk to the time it travelled out of sight was about 8 to 10 seconds and I estimate that the distance it travelled in that time was about 50 to 60 feet. Using these estimates, the disk was travelling at about 3 to 5 miles per hour. Unfortunately there was no time to take a picture, even with my cell phone.I am recently retired but was a government employee for 33 years and my husband works for a major airline. Our eyesight is fine and neither of us requires eyeglasses or contacts for driving. Immediately following this sighting I felt satisfied to have finally seen something concrete and real because it left no doubt that these objects do exist. Then I started wondering whether the fact that they do exist was a good thing or not. Knowing that there is technology far advanced than that held by us here on Earth is a bit unsettling. From our own history we know what usually happens when a technologically advanced civilization meets a less advanced society. I can only hope that whoever is controlling these objects has a less aggressive nature than us humans.  I am not overly worried about it, though, because I feel that if they meant to do us harm, they would have by now.  Perhaps they are just documenting our own self-destruction, via the proliferation of nuclear weapons, p! ollution, greenhouse gases, over population, genocide, chemical farming, antibiotics, destruction of the rainforests, and over fishing?  Maybe we are their version of watching a demolition derby; dirty, ugly and violent, but oh so entertaining!  We told friends about the sighting but, of course, most of them just laughed it off and asked how much we had been drinking at the time (which, by the way, was not at all). We humans do laugh when we are nervous about something, and we don&apos;t want to hear about something that makes us uncomfortable. And the quickest way to shut someone up is to ridicule them. So our friends reactions are normal, but we know what we saw. I don&apos;t think our government could keep such technology a secret. Even if they could, if we had it, we wouldn&apos;t be fighting wars to get oil because we would have a better propulsion system already. So what we saw was an Object, that was Flying and is Unidentified...a UFO."],

From where I stood the figure was smaller than the side of the moon, but larger than a commercial airplane in the sky.The figure appeared to be slowly hovering, moving from the east to the west.

It moved very rapidly... that is what scared me....if from here it moved very fast as a blink of an eye imagine how fast it really moved up there... it would move from left to right, right to left and slow! ly in a circle movement up and down.  Then after a while I noticed there were four more smaller ones to the left of it they were all lined up side by side....you couldn&apos;t see those as clear as the biggest one we seen first.

The object looked identical to the video taken in Moscow back in June 25-27, 2010.  The object was so high it looked like a star flickering in the distance.  With the naked eye, you can see it flickering colors of blue, red and yellow-white and it appeared to be standing still.  With the telescope, it appeared to be moving since I could not keep a fixed position on it.  The next day, a video was posted of the object during the day by another bystander.  You can view the video at www.latest-ufo-sitings.net, look for the August 6, 2010 video in San Antonio."],

I noticed overhead an object at about my 11 o clock position .  In shape it was somewhat like a spade from a deck of cards but less round. The first thing to come to mind was a phoenix, it was glowing very bright yellow and was flowy like feathers.  It was relatively small about 5 feet wide and 3 feet long.  It remained in that spot in my line of sight for a few seconds, then it simply vanished after turning pale in color, almost white.  After that happened for the rest of the way home,(just about 3.5 more miles), in the sky there were what appeared to be shooting stars going different random directions through the sky.  I saw approx. 10 of these before they stopped completely. This experience was the first I&apos;ve had in Oklahoma since my son and my fiance moved here from Maryland about 5 months ago.  Back in Maryland my fiance and I had separate sightings.  I strongly believe in intelligent life outside of our planet and what I saw tonight backs up my beliefs."],

I was sky gazing trying to see if there was any of the sun &ldquo;tsunami&rdquo; flare visible in the northern sky.  I didn&rsquo;t see anything then turned to look at South sky.  I didn&rsquo;t hear any helicopters, or other aircraft in the sky.  It was a very clear night, maybe some smoke in air from wildfires, no moon visible.Ages Female 49, Female 16. I am disabled Law Enforcement, have been both Dispatcher and Officer. Family has Law Enforcement background  I saw a light moving from East to West about mid sky, the silver light stopped and began moving in a zig zag motion then a spiral within an area of sky that could be covered by a 50 cent piece held at arms length. The light wasn&rsquo;t as bright as Jupiter but not as dim as a satellite moving in the sky. I yelled for my Great Niece to come out and see.We stood there for 15 minutes watching the light. It would move in spirals, zigzag, and linear, then would appear to remain in one spot with a quiver to it. The light stayed constant in intensity never changing its brightness. I flashed my LED flashlight at it to see if any response but it did nothing, I don&rsquo;t think my light could have been visible from any distance anyway. We thought of getting a camera to take a picture but our zoom isn&rsquo;t strong enough and too dark for it to pick out any detail of the sky.Before going to bed at 0010hrs 080610, I went back out to see if light was still visible, it was still in the sky still doing its spirals and odd movements. Still couldn&rsquo;t hear any aircraft that may have been in the area. Even the wildlife we have Owls, bears, and coyotes were quiet no real background noises other then from the open windows of house.The light was silver blue no real shape possible diamond, then possibly round. Was hard to tell when it &quot;quivered.&quot;  Just appeared to be a light that did not change its intensity. Was much brighter then the satellite that moved to its East from North to South that was barely visible to us. It was not as bright as Jupiter. The area of sky that it was in was in the Milky Way, in that band of bright stars. It was mid sky from the southern ridge of mountains to &quot;noon&quot; above us.((NUFORC Note:  We spoke via telephone with this witness, and she struck us as being an unusually capable, level-headed witness.  We strongly suspect that her report is quite accurate.  PD))"],

Since we are in the flight path of the Greater Cincinnati &ndash; Northern Kentucky Airport we thought these were smaller aircraft or helicopters judging from their speed which was slower than jets.These two objects were amber to almost orange in color and very easy to see. The size I would say was 3 &ndash; 4 times bigger than the planet Venus which is now prominent in the night skies. These 2 objects appeared to be at the same altitude but we could tell there were two separate objects.As they got closer to us, they appeared to slow down. There was no sound coming from these objects which really got us wondering what these were. The objects stopped moving completely for about 5 to 10 seconds then they both started moving slowly upward and we watched them disappear into the clouds.The weather conditions were windy because thunderstorms were in the area. Some low clouds were passing by but visibility was good. We are located about 15 miles west of Cincinnati near the Indiana border."],

Our family friend had told us all the flights were delayed or canceled  because of the thunder storm and severe rain we were having.  While we were standing outside his house in the drive way he saw a really bright light. He said, &quot;Come here and look at this.&quot;  I was standing where tree branches were blocking my view so I couldn&rsquo;t see what he was pointing at. When I stepped closer to where he was standing and looked into the night sky I saw a bright hovering disk (it had a disk like shape but the light surrounding it was rectangle).  It was very bright and looked far away, yet the whole craft was brilliantly lit. It emitted a yellow/golden light in color. We both stood looking at the flying object until it flew straight into the clouds.  During the short amount of time we saw the UFO, it maintained the hovering position, not moving anywhere, for about 5 seconds.  Then went up a few feet in the air (from our perspective) and back down to the original position.   After this the UFO flew straight up into the clouds at a super fast speed.  It looked like it disappeared. There were no more lights emitting from the craft.This is my first encounter with anything to do with UFO&rsquo;s or aliens. I can&rsquo;t explain what I saw. I don&apos;t know of any kind of aircraft so bright, has the same shape, can maintain a hover thousands of feet in the air, go at a fast speed straight up and all this during a thunder storm."],

Thats the best I can word what happened.

I am quite accustomed to seeing satelites, shooting stars and assorted aircraft, but last night was different.  I live outside of town and am very secluded.  The nights are gorgeous since there is no light polution.  I sat outside for about half an hour and was able to track several satelites.  I had just finished tracking my last satelite, watching it disappear above me over my house.  I immediately dropped my eyes back down to the horizon, looking southeast.  There is a large hill in front of where I live and it is covered in small pine.  Suddenly above the treeline appeared what I first thought was a star.  It hadn&apos;t been there a minute before.  It shown intensely bright, and I could not figure out what star, at that intense a magnitude, would be coming up in that place at that time.  It was way brighter than anything else in the sky.  I continued to think it was a very! bright star when I suddenly realized it was moving very, very slowly.  Then I got excited and thought perhaps I was looking at the ISS.  I have no idea how high it was, and there was no noise connected to it.  I watched it for about a minute as it traveled about the length of my hand - if I were to extend my arm.  It suddenly stopped, unlike anything I have ever seen.  It hung motionless and grew even more intense in its brightness, and then began to slowly dim until it became just a pin point of light, and disappeared.  The only way I can describe the object is that of a very bright, white light - like a huge star.  I have never seen anything act that way.  I would be curious to know if anyone else saw the same thing."],

        "description":["Elongated object with 7 white lightsDriving through Naval Weapons Base Fallbrook, Ca, at 2105 heading North East towards the city of Fallbrook  I noticed up ahead on my left side in the pasture 5 white lights that where to high up to be anything on the ground.  Being that I work with aircraft I noticed no red or green lights to distinguish port or starboard side of an aircraft.  I thought to myself it is just a few lights in the distance nothing to worry about.After seeing the lights I continued to drive my motorcycle towards Fallbrook. Up and to my right I spotted what I thought to be a deer.  The deer jumped the fence on the right side of the road and landed between me and the vehicle that was approxametly 20 feet in front of me. After landing in between myself and the vehicle in front of me it sprinted to the left side of the road almost being hit by a vehicle going south east towards Camp Pendleton then disappeared.  The animal that to me seabed to be a 4 legged animal that resembled a deer, but was shorter in the back legs than the front and more of a black color than a deer would be.After the animal or thing ran across road I noticed the lights where no longer on my right but where now on my left side. The closer I got towards the lights it became more obvious in shape to me. The shape best I can describe was oblong like a football, but more elongated.  I counted 5 white lights that where going down the length of the object and 2 more white lights.  One being towards the top of the object an the other towards the bottom of the object both going in slow steady circles around the object and disappearing when going to the other side.Continuing to drive I watched the object on my bike till I could no longer see it without having to turn around on my bike. I then tried looking in my mirrors to try and see the object.  I was not able to spot anything in my mirror so I turned and looked on my bike to see if the object was still there.  Having turned around I noticed the object had vanished.After seeing what I saw I continued to drive through base. After exiting the base I along with the car in front of me an behind me stopped at the red light.  The car behind me drove up beside me and asked me if I had seen what he had saw. I proceeded to tell him and he said that&apos;s exactly what he had seen as well.  After talking with that person I pulled my bike up towards the vehicle in front of me.  Both the driver and passenger of that vehicle told me they seen the exact same thing.&nbsp;"],

I was looking in the direction that the flash appeared to originate from, in the southwest portion of the sky near Douglas Park, (a new commercial and housing development near the Long Beach Airport) and saw a vibrant but undiscernible arc or point of green light low in the sky, slightly above the rooftop level of a house across the street. One friend of mine, who was facing the other direction, also saw the flash but observed that it lower in intensity and appeared to have come from behind him.Several friends of mine living in an area in the general direction of the flash--in the Lakewood Country Club--reported having lost power at the time, several minutes later via facebook. The flash event lasted only a brief second, and neither I nor my companions heard any sort of noise in the seconds following the anomaly.I suspect that the flash was caused by a copper or thallium-containing iron meteorite, which would explain the green color of the flash, the lack of accompanying sound, and EMP which knocked out power.

They seemed to disappear in an upward direction after their westward flight.Being truly amazed and never seing anything like this before, I went home and searched online for ufo&apos;s in South Elgin Illinois and realized that other people have been seing the same thing that my friends and I saw that night, not to mention a story about secret base in the area of the new bridge construction site.

All of a sudden we both saw a black apache helicopter fly no more than 100 ft off the ground and directly over head of us.  Later that night I was sitting out on my porch in South Elgin, Il. It was around 12:30 am when i looked up in the sky and saw an object ive never seen before.  It slowly hovered up and over the tree line directly east from me.  I watched this orange and yellow light slowly rise.  The top portion of the object was bright orange shaped like an upside down bowl.  It had a bright yellow band in the center, with the the orange shape repeating it self on the bottom.  I watched it hover in spot for several minutes, then slowly move into the tree line.  After it moved into the tree line it then shot directly into the sky outta sight.  At that time it left i heard several helicopters in the area.  From where i was sitting it was roughly 3-5 miles away.  From my point of view I was sitting at a! n angle of 60 degrees from my postion.  I was born and rasied in the chicagoland area, for 25 years of my life i lived at an end of a runway in Elk Grove Village.

We were fishing facing the south direction.  My brother in law said, &quot;Hey man, I just saw 2 shooting stars.&quot;  Immediately he said, &quot;Dude, what the hell is that.&quot;  I turned and looked in a south facing direction and my eyes locked on a bright orange glowing object.  It appeared to be in a triangle with a flat shaped nose.  The visibility last night was unlimited.  There were clouds to the east of our location and the object was definitely below the cloud height.  The object was glowing the entire time as it moved across the sky.I would estimate the height of the object to be about 1200 feet off the ground.  It moved very fast, steady and very smooth as it flew across the sky.  It was absolutely 100% not an airplane.  Being in the Air Force for almost 11 years I have seen my fair share of aircraft and this was most certainly not one.  It made absolutely no sound.  I would estimate the object to be about 2 1/2 miles away from where we were.  The sighting lasted approx 25 seconds.  From the time I first viewed the object to the time I could no longer see it had moved about 110 degrees across the sky east to west.  The object was moving in a west direction down the shore line of Oahu.  We were right beside the airport when this happened so I know Honolulu International Airport picked this object up on their radar.  I wish everyone could have seen this as it was truly amazing!!!"],

To fully view the light we continued through the densely wooded area to an opening on top of a hill.  The front seat passenger and rear seat passenger tried to identify it as a star, however, it was visibly much larger than any of the other stars in the sky, including Venus and Jupiter.  Also, it was a different color than either of the planets and due to the size, appeared much closer.  As we rounded the road to the top of the hill, about a mile and a half away from sighting the first light, the rear and front seat passengers turned to face the object, which had now drifted to the Northeast.  Upon relocating the object, and getting above the tree line, they noticed another light to the East.  I, the driver, was also able to see the objects clearly.We were only about a half a mile from McHardy Road, which runs North and South; we decided to turn North onto it to get a better view.  While turning and advancing down the road the sky became more visible as the trees receded below us and about three more orange objects were clearly visible.The two passengers kept their eyes one the objects as we proceeded another half mile North on McHardy before pulling over and stopping the vehicle.  It was then 12:07 and we exited the car to watch the objects.  At this time, we decided to call the NUFORC hotline and report the sighting; also there now appeared to be seven orange orbs in the sky.  During this time, the objects seemed to drift or float toward the Northeast slightly, and nearly one by one they faded out.  It did not appear that they moved beyond our visible sight, just that they were fading and no longer present. It took approximately three minutes for the entire group of lights to completely fade (12:10am).About thirteen minutes passed and the lights failed to return so we decided to get back into the car and head East in the general direction of the lights.  We traveled into Manly, Minnesota, before deciding to call it a night and turn back.  (NOTE: although many of the streetlights in this area were similar in color, what we witnessed were very clearly in the sky and above the horizon, also they were moving) The next day we phoned the National Weather Service and found that the wind direction was going South at three miles per hour that night, and not to the Northeast, the direction in which the objects were moving.All three of us are students at reputable Universities and involved in noteworthy activities on campus. None of us were under the influence of any legal or illegal drugs or alcohol."],

It did not seem too far away, traveled in a straight path, did not have any sort of tail, and wasn&rsquo;t really fire as much as glowing and omitting light from all directions.  Its movement was more floating than flying and was very fluid.  You could not see a definitive shape to the object and it was definitely not a plane.  As it got farther away it appeared to slow down or possibly stopped, but that could have just been the depth of field playing tricks on my eyes.  I called a friend and described it to her in hopes she could see it from her house, but no luck.  The whole experience lasted at least 5 minutes.

In all their were at least 10 glowing orbs that all followed a southwestern path and then disappeard.  I do believe in UFO&apos;s,but I&apos;m thinking someone set off some sort of glowing objects maybe with parachutes or something.

        "description":["UFO&apos;s over SilverlakeI live in the Silverlake section of Los Angeles and I was having coffee at an outdoor table when I noticed what looked like a round white thing in the sky.  It was very high up and was moving north. After a few seconds, it turned right and headed west in a straight line and at the same speed.  A few minutes later, I and my girlfriend noticed other objects like the one I have described and for the next hour and a half we watched 14 or  more of them moving west in a straight line and one consistant speed which was rather slow. Most of the objects looked round but some were triangle shaped.  Most were moving slowly west but, some just hoovered in one spot.  One hoovered for 30 min and then slowly moved north. I went to the army surplus across the street and told the guys working there about the objects.  They got some binoculars and we looked at one of the objects.  Through the bino&apos;s I could see that the object was 3 white orbs held in a triangle frame like thing.  And as we watched another white object moved toward this 3-orbed object and was very neat it before it vanished. All of the objects were very high up.  When jets would pass by , one could see that these objects were way higher in the sky than the jets.The objects made no sound , they made turns, changed directions , and moved in straight lines as well as hovering.  NO high speed stuff.  One thing I noticed, when I was looking at some of these objects, I would notice another similar object  behind the object I was looking at that was much much higher up.((NUFORC Note:"],

        "description":["Brilliant green object, seems to launch smaller white objetcOn 07/31/2010 I was on my back porch looking at the sky.  The sky was clear with just a few scattered clouds. I had originally gone out to see what was happening, as about an hour earlier, a pair of Blackhawk helicopters were circling the area, extremely low with only their battle lights on.  I ended up looking at the stars after they left.  At 2152 hrs I noticed what seemed to be a satellite approaching from the south, about 30 degrees above the horizon. It was moving rather slow for a satellite and moving towards the northwest.  It started as a dim white color but began increasing in size and intensity.  Just when I thought I was about to see a good iridium flare, I realized that instead of flaring and then subsiding, this object was continuing to increase in size and brilliance.  It became huge, larger and brighter than Saturn visible to the west, and the color was now an unusual shade of light green around the edge and brilliant white in the center.  It appeare! d to be self-illuminated and not reflecting the sun.  It remained at its brightest for several seconds, then it suddenly went completely dark for a fraction of a second, then returned with full brilliance.  Concurrent with this display, I noticed a small, white object shooting off to the west at a slight downward angle.  The white object looked like a small, very slow meteor leaving a short trail.  It appeared slightly below the green object and quite a bit to the right of it, but the trajectory of the white object in relation to the green object gave me the impression it had shot out from it. (It is possible that it was just a meteor as there was nothing unusual about it other than its appearance and proximity to the green object.)  The green object, after re-appearing, remained illuminated for a about a second, then rapidly diminished in size and became completely dark. It did not just blink off but seemed to &quot;power down.&quot;At 2202 hrs., I saw a two more objects one after another, almost directly overhead going from south to north. They performed similarly to the large green object, but did not become as bright and they remained white in color.  They too grew in intensity, flashed on and off several times and then went dark.  I checked the Heavens Above website and discovered that there were NO iridium satellites visible from my location on that date, and the other known objects that were visible were not overhead at the times or locations of these sightings."],

We are located at the outer limits of approach aircraft.The object appeared as a bright reflective object, located N30E, approximately 30 to 35 degrees above the horizon.

This object was somewhat stationary and seemed to rise like a balloon, but never this bright and never a shape which seemed to rotate, vary in brightness and shape.Object seemed to hover and slightly rise in the sky until it just vanished.  At one point when the object seemed to nearly disappear, observation what I thought was a much larger triangular object, just catching a straight edge about twenty diameters in length as compared to the bright object (no color, bright white starlike).  It disappeared shortly thereafter.  I looked for it but never saw it again. The duration of this observation lasted about 15 min."],

        "description":["Four lights at dusk that appear then dissaappearI was sitting outside with a friend having dinner in his garden.  I was sitting at a table between two modular homes. I was facing approximately, North, North-East.  At the time of the siting, I looked up about 45 degrees and saw a light in the sky.  Then there was a second light to the left of the first one. I first thought there these were early stars, but the sky was still quite blue, the star Antaries, which usually came out first, directly above, was not out yet.My first thought was that I was seeing an aircraft, or a satellite, or a space station.  I commented to my friend about seeing two lights.  Then the one to the left started to move to the left.  As it did, two other lights appeared about these first two.  They were closer together than the firs two.  Then the second light that moved to the left disappeared.  Thie direction would be toward the North West. Now there was just the three.  Then the upper two lights disappeared followed by the first light.I was puzzled because, these lights really looked like faint stars, but it was too early for stars to appear. The final formation of these four points of light could be labeled like the geometric figure known as a trapezoid.  The lower left point of light was the one that moved away. I tried to see if the other three moved in any direction. They did not. They only disappeared.Thirty minutes later when the Great Dipper came out I tried to get my bearings to determine which part of the sky these lights appeared. This was approximately above the constellation of Cassiopeia.  But not as high as the North Star.This siting was so unusual that I got up from the dinner table and started mentioning to my friend that there were some lights in the sky and that one was moving. It was shortly after standing up that the other two higher lights appeared and then disappeared. My friend also got up from the table.  I pointed to the area of the sky where I was seeing the lights.  I asked him if he saw the lights, but he said he did not see any lights.Usually I wear contact lenses in both eyes.  For over a month I have not worn a contact lens in my left eye, in order to prepare for an eye test, prior to cataract surgery.  I was only wearing one contact lens in my right eye.   My vision in my right eye, with corrective lens is better than normal.  It is between 20/50 and 20/70.   I am very certain that I say what I saw.  Also, I have an uncanny suspicion, that these lights were part of the same phenomenon."],

When I looked up, I saw 3 lights, red, green and blue in a triangle formation rotating in a clockwise direction.  The lights were pulsating/blinking very fast.  The object was moving from East to West towards the Tappan Zee Bridge.  At first I thought it was an airplane, but I very quickly realized that this was something like I have never seen before.  It moved at the same speed as a plane but I could not hear any noise.  After about 30 seconds, I lost sight of it behind the trees, but appeared to be heading towards the Hudson River.  When I first saw it, I was facing North- North - East, and it was at about a 60 degree angle.  The lights were larger than those on airplanes.  I would imagine that someone on the Tappan Zee or I-287 would have seen it since I live so close to the highway."],

The bottom light was peach, and the next one was red...as we thought we were looking at a light tower that had been tipped at 45 degrees to the right...though we knew no towers were there.  Then we noticed 2 more peach lights above that... the heighth from the ground unknown.  The 4 lights moved TOGETHER and kept a common onterval...seeming as if it were one object.  To me it looked as if it were a triangle shape... or closed V- shape.  The opening of the V was pointed West and the point, as it were, was to the East.  The object was moving very rapidly to the North West very rapidly.

        "description":["bright light in sky every night for last 8 nights and counting CAFor about the last 7 or 8 evenings, starting at roughly sundown (around 8:30 pm) , a very bright light appears in the sky over what I estimate to be Camarillo, which is the next town north from where I witness this strange nightly occurrence.  I have viewed it from several different vantage points, both with the naked eye and with binoculars, a well as taken pictures.  Anybody who looks up at the sky could clearly see it. It is not being shy or covert at all.  It doesn&rsquo;t seem to move much except to make a very slow descent behind the big mountain that makes up one half of the Camarillo grade (101 freeway, where truck scales are), so by 11:30 or so, it ha disappeared from my view. It does appear to change colors occasionally, from brilliant white, to a hazy yellowish orange, to a bluish white glow, and sometimes a red aura appears on the top part of whatever this is. It also appeared to have some much smaller, much dimmer lights come off it in several instances over the past week.  Because there is a military base nearby ( Point Mugu) I at first thought it was some kind of helicopter holding its position in a military exercise of some kind. And it might be just that, I don&rsquo;t know what it is at this point.I wouldn&rsquo;t have even come here to post this, except for a caller I heard on the Coast to Coast  radio show that described how he was seeing a strange bright light in the sky from sundown to 11:30pm, and this had been every evening for the last week or so. He went on to describe the very same characteristics that the light I was seeing possessed. The show host told this caller to report his sighting on this website. So I figured I should do the same with my sighting, for whatever its worth. I unfortunately did not hear where the caller was calling from, but would like to find out if it&rsquo;s the same light or two different ones in two separate places. I guess I will just continue to watch it at night, and to try to get some better pictures of it.((NUFORC Note:  Sighting of Venus in the western sky, we suspect. PD))"],

MUFON says this is impossible.The first of four appear directly over the City Of Reading, PA.  It is NOT VENUS. It is BIG and BRIGHT looking, through binoculars, like a kryptonite headlight.  When it first appears it sometimes looks like a white circle with light beams coming off it.It goes through about 20 minutes of &quot;development&quot; during which time it becomes larger, brighter and drops lower in altitude.  During this time, also, it develops a metallic protrusion at the five o&apos;clock position...we often refer to it here as the ((deleted)).Around 9:30 the second, third and fourth appear very high in the sky and much farther out.  They clearly come from the same factory.  We now call them JFV1, 2 3 and 4 in honor of John Forester, the Managing Editor of The Reading Eagle who continues to insist #1 is Venus.The biggest, closest and brightest (JFV1) then goes through his nightly routine of travelling a semi-circle over and away from the city getting so low the camera is well-below the LEVEL point.  Throughout his routine, he is approached by INTRUDERS that look just like stereotypical flying saucers and the like. These are not visible to the naked eye but are captured quite well by 14mp and 900mm Pentax SMC lens.The INTRUDERS seem to use JFV1 as if it were a New Jersey Traffic Circle.  Sometimes they seem to be in conflict.  JFV1 often contorts into ugly shapes when they are moving too fast or too close...very weird but they are definitely communicating.STRANGE PHYSICS...When taken out-of-focus JFV1 becomes OTHER clear and IN-FOCUS OBJECTS usually in the form of a nonagon.  Surfaces of the nonagon can be presented looking like a bucket of garbage or even the scene of PA countryside from an airplane.  ALSO when in the nonagon aspect NOTHING ELSE is visible in the sky.I am emailing some photos.((NUFORC Note:  We suspect that the object, or objects, may be celestial bodies.

Well then he saw another one in the same part of the sky and then I saw another one again also in the same part of the sky the first two had been in I concluded it had to be a meteor shower, then his girl friend said &quot;What that moving up there?&quot; we were all looking up and we watched as this small little dot moved across the sky I figured it was a satellite it appeared to make a straight line but more like those carts from IKEA make a straight line... NW in direction hugging the west.

        "description":["Bright Light That Changed Intensity and Color, Then DisappearedI arrived at my home in the northern San Gabriel Valley on the night of Thursday 29 July 2010 at 21:10 PDT.  As is my habit, when I got out of the car I looked up and surveyed the nighttime sky. Looking in a south-easterly direction I noticed what looked to be an airplane. Again, as is my habit, I looked for the FAA lights (blinking red and green lights). I did not see any.  The light was pretty bright, so it&apos;s possible that, due to the angle and the brightness of the light, I just couldn&apos;t see them. I also noticed the speed, which seemed relatively normal for an airplane.  The trajectory was mostly straight, though for a moment I could have sworn that I saw it drift to the east just a bit. This could have been an optical illusion.  However, over the course of the 20 or so seconds that I was watching, I saw the light increase in brilliance.  The object seemed to get bigger, though this might have been an effect of the increasing luminosity, changing from an off-w! hite color to more of a resplendent white. This lasted about 5 seconds, after which the light dimmed, making the object seem as if it were getting smaller. As it dimmed it became blue, like so many stars.  What was left, for a moment, was a dim dot of light surrounded by an even fainter corona; it resembled the dot of light that would be left in the center of the screen on old black-and-white televisions immediately after being turned off.  This lasted for just a moment, after which the dot became smaller and dimmer, until disappearing altogether. I kept looking at the sky for at least another ten minutes, in case it was an airplane that had turned it&apos;s lights off momentarily, but the light did not reappear.  I could not see the outline of any kind of craft, nor was there a sound to be heard."],

As I continued to investigate, it slowly -- and at a deliberate and even pace - traversed east across the moon.I got the sense I was witnessing something quite unique and even though it sounds mundane as I type this, it was truly awesome as it stretched as far north and south as the eye could see.  It was geometrically perfect, narrowing at both ends.  If I had to guess at what it might be, I could only say that I believe it was a deliberate mass of something that had a specific purpose.As it arrived close to the moon and was about to cross it, I could determine it was approximately twice as wide as the moon, and as it traveled east and away from the moon, it got dimmer until I could no longer make out the outline.NOTE: I am a frequent sky watcher, C2C listener and have observed (and filmed) many unexplained phenomena and I have never seen anything like this before."],

I have observed what would appear to be &quot;black clouds&quot; moving at will across the sky.  Some will contain lights which move within the clouds and in the last couple of days, the lights have actually been moving from cloud to cloud.  Last week for the first time, the lights were orginally white within the black area, but then in one particular cloud, they started flashing red.  Again, tonight I witnessed the lights, several in one black cloud, change from white to red.  Not all of them changed colors.  These clouds are located in the southern sky from my vantage point and will move both horizontally and vertically at will.  There does not seem to be any particular pattern to them.  I have seen them almost every night and have tried to figure out if there was a pattern that could be explained, but it just does not seem possible that someone on the ground could be creating this activity since sometimes, several of the &quot;black lit clouds&quot; are moving in different directions at the same time, again with no pattern."],

        "description":["Triangle shaped formation of lights slowed and stopped, then changed direction and flew off.On the night of July 18, 2010 at around 10:00 pm in Chico, Ca, while walking home from the store, I witnessed what I thought at first was an airplane.  Upon looking at it closer I noticed that the light formation on it was different than the airplanes that I&rsquo;m so used to seeing. What caught my attention was that it was moving abnormally slow for an airplane, but on par with maybe a helicopter or blimp. For a minute, I thought it could be an ultra light aircraft, but it was completely silent.  Next I thought maybe the lights on the bottom of a blimp, but I have never witnessed a blimp in 15 years of living here.  My best guess was that it was triangle shaped, but it was very hard to make out with city lights around. This thing whatever it was made absolutely no noise.  It kept slowing down and finally stopped and sat there for about 10 seconds before changing course.  It was initially heading west but stopped and changed course to heading due north. When it changed direction it went straight over head.  As it flew over I tried to make out what it was.  It had three white lights in a triangle formation with one blinking red light in the middle with one additional slightly dimmer blinking white light mixed in.   The red light was slightly brighter than the rest of the lights. It didn&rsquo;t seem to be very far up at all, and it wasn&rsquo;t very big that I could tell.  Before it changed course, it was sort of near the moon I could make out sort of a roundish looking bottom to it, but only for a second. As it moved northward, it picked up speed to what would be expected of an airplane.  I ran into the house to get my video camera, but when I came out it was way far off.I am quite used to planes flying over and see them often.  I don&rsquo;t however EVER see a plane slow down, stop, and then completely change course.   It was very eerie watching that fly overhead with no noise at all!  The blinking red light seemed to indicate that it was manmade, but who knows?   Whatever it was it gave me the creeps!  I&rsquo;m a student here, and have good eyesight and wasn&rsquo;t at all drunk or anything.  This was not the first weird thing I&rsquo;ve seen here either.  On Dec, 23 and 24 of 2009, I saw a ball of light out in the distance that looked like the spot light on the front of a helicopter, but got dimmer and after it travelled some distance faded into nothing.  I saw this twice in two days!  I followed the second one for a block or so on foot just watching before it finally blinked out.  I highly doubt it was &quot;Chinese lanterns&quot; as some might say.  These were not flickering, and they were Venus bright at times and silent.((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.  PD))"],

It happened so fast that I wasn&apos;t sure if maybe I was just seeing things, but when my sister in law said, &quot;OH MY GOD DID YOU SEE THAT?!&quot; I knew I wasn&apos;t.   I turned on the outside light and saw nothing.  Not even 30 seconds after the fire station alarm was going off, why is unknown.  I have to say that this was the weirdest, spookiest thing I have seen in my life.  My sister in law wil! l be reporting as well, as I said this was out of the corner of my eye, she saw it dead on."],

I noticed the neighbors house directly in front of ours was lit up also, the rest of the neighborhood was pitch dark as it should have been.  In the center of the circumfrence of green light there was a dimmer transparent ball.  The ball never changed its color it stayed the same, while the outer part dimmed, went bright then dimmed, then bright, then just seemed to collapse into the ball.  It then just dissapated.

        "description":["Orange glowing balls over rural Florida Lake.Yesterday night, right around 11:45pm I witnessed 2 Orange glowing balls.  It was distant, but was bright enough to reflect light off of Little Lake George on the St. Johns river in North Florida.  I was looking almost exactly South, With a clear view of the Stars and the moon was not a factor, it was behind me.  It was Clear,  but with Clouds that had rolled in off of the Atlantic. It was in the sky when I noticed it.  I smoked a cigarette watching it, I&apos;d say 7 minutes total time watching it.  It looked at first as if it was stationary, but very high in the air.  I&apos;d obviously say no more than 6 miles away.  Stayed stationary for about 5 1/2 minutes.  It started moving at an incredible speed from right to left then down lower and lower away and down below the horizon, never losing luminosity.  I&apos;ve spent a lot of time in that spot, and I&apos;ve never seen that before. I&apos;ve seen night training, I&apos;ve seen jets buzzing the tops of trees, following the river down to the ra! nge.  Not that big, Not that bright. No exhaust vents on a jet can put out that much light,  There is nothing in that direction, no light, no civilization for that matter for about 30-35 miles. The lake goes out for 2 miles, and reflected the light. Around 30 miles down the river and through the forest is the Ocala National Forests Bombing range.  I&apos;ve seen Flares, I&apos;ve seen training over that thing more than once, Night and Day.  After the bombing range is the Umatilla Municipal Airport.  Way too far away, in my opinion, that&apos;s around 50-60 or greater miles away.  If it were a flare, from a boat on Lake George, once again, I&apos;d have ruled it out.There were visible aircraft in the Area, with green and red lights, blinking. They were obvious commercial Aircraft.I called my friend, explained what was going on, while watching it. That was 3 minutes in. He works at a Government facility near Jacksonville and asked if he was busy with anything that night, I&apos;ll keep that interpretation up to you. There is a Power Station North of the site, and I thought well maybe it is some kind of reflection. He said no.  He will talk to me in person soon about this, But because of the sensitivity of his job, I&apos;m not sure if he will.  He&apos;s a close friend though.As for myself, That&apos;s where I was, that&apos;s what I saw. My  Anonymousness is no matter,  My Personal description is one of a College Educated Young man. I don&apos;t have any experience with Military Aircraft, but talked to someone via phone during the event that does. I&apos;ve also never seen a UFO or anything for that matter that I can&apos;t explain easily. This was something entirely different."],

After trying to put sticks under the tire to get leverage to drive out we gave up and decided to walk to the main road we drove on and to stay on that road until we could find a house to call for help..(We were in the middle of nowhere.) We walked I would guess 3 miles then us 4 including myself saw two &quot;balls of fire&quot; in the air about 30 yards off the road we were walking on. They did not appear to be large, maybe the size of a basketball. They moved quickly in all kinds of directions. Not sure how to explain it. We got scared and started running down the road, until we were a good distance away from the &quot;fire balls&quot;. We stopped and watched and the 2 fire balls continued to move quickly in many directions but never really leaving the same area. We were still scared so decided to run again. W! e ran until the fireballs were out of sight. (Ran for about 5 minutes streight). This has caused me psycologic issues, I am now on several medications including sleeping pills due to the fact that I can&apos;t sleep at night because it still freightens me. I&apos;m only 21 years old, and I was not drunk or on any drug at the time this happened. My brother and his roommate and my friend all saw it. My friends roommmate died a week ago in the same area due to losing control of his car. (Its unknown why he was out in the middle of nowhere,and still unknown how he lost control of his car,possibly a deer ran out in front of him.) I don&apos;t believe in &quot;aliens&quot;, but somthing is going on I swear to god and I&apos;m christian.The fire balls were a dark red on the inside and a lighter red/pink on the outside.They moved very quickly in a &quot;z&quot; like way.It was about the size of a basketball I would guess. This is not a joke. This has caused me neurology issues, and now have to take medications to keep me sane pretty much.Thanks for listening."],

Sky completely clear.Location: LAT 36.87, LONG. -120.78  I was driving northbound on Interstate 5 in central California.  I noticed two bright white disk-shaped objects, very close together, very distinctive as opaque objects, with a thin dark grey edge, meandering through the sky, sort of slowly circling each other but together moving swiftly southward down the valley.  They seemed about 2 miles up. No trails or glow, just two waferlike disc objects, not natural, not spherical.  These were definitely manufactured objects. They were not birds or balloons that is for sure.The edges of the two disks were crisp and defined, and there was no reflection, like it had a white matte finish.  No markings that I could see.  When I first looked I thought it could be two aircraft. But then I focused and realized these were round and the way they behaved together, sort of a figure 8 motion to each other as they moved collectively and rapidly through the air heading down the valley, I have never seen that before with aircraft.What were they?"],

They didn&apos;t flash or anything- they stayed red for about the first 15 seconds then switched to white for about 2 seconds, then back to red and it was gone from my view with the airplane still trying to keep up.  This is the most amazing thing I have ever seen in my entire life.  I wish I&apos;d had someone to see it with me for verification purposes, but I know what I saw.((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides little contact information.

I just Googled: &quot;orange triangle light glow over salt lake city tonight disappears&quot; which led me to another site.  I thought I would find others who saw this. someone suggested this site to report what I saw.  If I thought it was going to disappear like that I would have taken a picture.Well to the right of the full moon from my perspective, maybe 20 degrees, I just noticed a very strange orange flame like light that appeared to be heading North toward the Avenues (it was to the South of me). I presumed it was odd colored forward lights to a plane flying low in the Valley.  It was odd from the start.  It was like a triangle in the center surrounded by a flaming orange with almost a tail of the same flaming orange. I stared at it for 2 minutes expecting it to eventually make sense.  But it didn&rsquo;t. It didn&rsquo;t move much really.  Never any noise.  I was expecting and listening for an engine noise that never came.Then it started to fade. I thought it was turning away, but then it faded, still visible but smaller.  Then it totally disappeared.  I thought maybe it went behind a cloud.  But there were no clouds in the sky in that area at all.In total I witnessed this for about two minutes.  And at arms length, it would have taken a full fingernail to cover it up.The Orange balls of light I see here described by others in other areas sound very similar.((ADDENDUM SUBMITTED BY WITNESS))Possible explainations of what i saw in Salt Lake City last night((name deleted)) in Salt Lake City 24 hours later:  I&rsquo;ve tried to make sense of what I saw last night and came up with two plausible theories.  The first, which I have disqualified is that I was witnessing a reentry by the Space Shuttle at a much greater distance than I originally perceived and at an angle more or less directly toward my position.The second, is that I was watching some sort of burning balloon.  I had this notion in my mind tonight and then saw some you tube videos on Chinese lanterns.  If that is what I saw, it was quite large and was either on fire entirely, or was supporting an enormous flame before burning out.  This does however explain the orange flame color, the lack of sound, the slow movement, and the ultimate disappearance if it were to burn itself out.Still, I wish someone would confirm they saw what I saw last night, or someone would confess to launching the thing.  Like I say, I saw it for two minutes before it disappeared.  It could have been there much longer before I noticed it upon admiring the full moon.((END ADDENDUM))"],

        "description":["We saw a group of about 12 dim lights moving together in the night sky in a graceful fluid pattern.(boy) It was around 10:45 p.m., when myself and my girlfriend were taking a late night walk around the outside of the college campus.  After walking for awhile we decide to lay down and relax for a bit in a nice grassy area.  It was a nice spot with many small trees well spaced apart.  Me and her were relaxing just talking looking up into the sky when I first spotted a group of lights.  I then pointed and said to her &quot;what&apos;s that?&quot; &quot;right there...that group of lights&quot; then I jokingly told her &quot;right there it&apos;s a UFO.&quot;  Of course she didn&apos;t believe and said something a long of the lines of &quot;no it&apos;s not!,&quot; but then 30 seconds later she spotted it as well.  So then for a good five minutes we watch the group of lights trying to talk out what it might be.(boy) The pattern of the lights is best described in my opinion is that of a school of fish swimming together. It was about 10 to 12 very dim lights in the very far distance (past the cloud line) moving around together in a very fluid motion.  The overall movement was not in a straight line, but as I said like a school of fish moving in a large circle.  Very fluid, very pretty, and very graceful movements.  The lights were very hard to keep track of, and we both had to strain our eyes to see it, but what we both saw is very consistent and unmistakable.(boy) Neither of us can say that we believe that is was aliens or anything to that effect, but what we did see doesn&apos;t a line with anything we&apos;ve seen before.  It could not have been a plane, helicopter, or satellite.  It was very foreign to us, and I thought it would be best to report while the event was still fresh in our minds.(Girl)  I don&apos;t exactly know how to describe what i saw because i have never seen anything that nearly resembles it.  To me it looked as if an invisible bubble that was nearly the size of the moon was containing a small group of 12 or so fire flies.  The light didn&apos;t move like fire flies, the movement of the light was so fluid and graceful. It was so hard to see the lights at times but once you had your eye on the lights it was unmistakable what you saw.  The lights almost looked red to me but I&apos;m not sure, just like dim stars look red sometimes.  The lights moved together in random patterns, but as they moved in their sphere they as a group moved in a circular movement.  The lights didn&apos;t flash at all they were completely solid unlike a plane light or like a twinkling star.  We watched it together and discussed what we saw for about three minutes until a cloud moved in front of the lights and then it was completely out of sight.  There was no sign of the lights through the ! clouds.  We sat for about a minute and were a little confused at what we saw and decided to get up and go home and tell my boyfriends family what we had seen.(Girl) While we had been watching the lights I had mentioned that we should call someone so that they could come outside and see what we had seen but then I realized that no one would be able to see it unless they knew where to look and also the light pollution is bad and we had been lucky enough to have stopped in a slightly dense area of trees.  It was barely dark enough for the two of us to see it.((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.  PD))"],

        "description":["Large, white, dome shaped object spotted near a  &quot;Janet&quot; plane in Las VegasI smoke cigarettes from my second floor balcony many times throughout the day.  My balcony faces Northeast towards Nellis Airforce Base in Las Vegas, NV, and has a clear view of the northeastern section of sky.  As I smoke, I frequently watch planes landing or taking off from Mcarren Airport, or I watch aircraft fly to and from Nellis.  On August 27th around 3 p.m. I was on my balcony, and I noticed right away that a plane was approaching Las Vegas from the North. Whats interesting about that is Ive learned through months of everyday observing that planes do not fly in from the North, so I picked up my binoculars (used for watching the planes and helicopters fly from Nellis) and saw that it was one of those &quot;Janet&quot; planes that transport employees to and from Area 51 (Classic red stripe passenger plane with no identifiable markings). As I followed the plane with my binoculars, I then noticed something appear in my field of vision that was further away beyond the! Janet plane. I stopped and adjusted my binocs to get a clearer image of what this object was, and once I did I could see a white, solid, dome shaped object hovering in place far off in the distance. I know distances can be deceiving, so I dont want to say how far away i think it was exactly, but I can say it was miles, beyond Sunrise mountain and perhaps even Lake Mead. I stood and watched it for 2-3 minutes until I noticed another Janet plan coming into approach at McCarran. I took my eyes off the craft for only a second and when I scanned the area it had been, it was gone! I searched the entire sky for about 20 minutes and never saw it again. It was dome shaped, white and never moved from the spot I first saw it. I assume that it was far away, and if it was then I would say the craft was huge. Being stationary, I was able to study it for 2-3 minutes through my binoculars and though it was too far to make out any details, I can say it was big enough to clearly make out it! s shape. I am absolutely certain that it was not a plane, heli! copter, weather balloon, or any other craft Ive ever seen in my life. It was a clear, hot summer day with no clouds in sight. I hope you find this information useful.((NUFORC Note:  We have corrected the date above.  PD))"],

To the naked eye, it was about the size and brightness of Jupiter, slightly less.  My attention had been kept because this star had a pulsating twinkle to it, where it would twinkle white, red and green colors while keeping a white color to it.  The twinkling was rather fast, not a slow changing in colors, but pulsating.  The object was always stationary and did not move.  The first 10 minutes I looked at it with my naked eye.  I then went in the house and looked at it again for 10 more minutes with 8 X 21 binoculars, no change in size but still had the same pulsation to it.  I then went inside and spent 10 minutes looking at online star maps and satellite tracking maps on Nasa.gov, went back outside and it was gone.  I never saw how it disappeared.  I will attempt to look again in the sky tonight at the same tim! e to see if it appears again.((ADDENDUM TO REPORT FROM WITNESS))Disregard last entryFollowup on previous entry from day before.

My mother&rsquo;s boyfriend, noticed something gliding through the sky.  The object was noticed in the eastern sky flying in a SSW direction.  We had visual observation of the craft for about 5 minutes before it faded out of sight.The craft was a silver cigar shape with a dark band in the middle.  I could not make out any wings or a tail.  It was completely silent, and there was no contrail.  I live in the hills.  Most planes go out of sight over a hill, but unlike most airplanes I see, this did not go over the horizon out of sight.  Rather, the object seemed to get smaller and smaller, until it was no longer visible.There was a sense of confusion upon realizing all the strange attributes of this craft.  I managed to remember to grab my camera and I was able to capture several photos on a Nikon D-3000 DSLR camera."],

I got up after it was gone and looked around outside at which the dog came running up to me but there was no evidence of anything outside I know im not insane I was afraid to tell anyone at work I know what i heard I know it was not any type of plane or copter I grew up on base next to the runway and been air force all my life.

It was round, but it looked like it had a web of lights on top of it, making it look almost teardrop shaped.  At first, I considered it was flames.  I thought it might be a comet falling from the sky, so I turned onto 13 Mile road and pulled into the parking lot of the apartments that were west of Grove.  It had gotten higher in the sky at this point and looked like an orange dot.  It started moving north. I took a picture of it and watched it for a few minutes.

        "description":["Four Red Saucer Shaped Objects Fly Over Falmouth, MaineWalking out to my car at 22:49 on July 26, 2010, I witnessed what appeared to be three saucer shaped objects gliding in the sky from the southwest.  They emitted red and orange light over their entire surface, almost as if the light was being reflected from their surface.  The orange and red light was hazy but it spread in every direction; similar to the same effect that takes place when one squints while looking a street light at night.  The moon was entirely full and these objects were easily detectable.  They moved very fluidly as they flew to the northeast.  They made no sound and they flew as if they were all separate entities; flying closer and farther apart.  It seemed as if they were gliding because they were almost dipping in the sky, but they also rose.  They flew very smoothly, but it seemed as if they were suspended at times and even slightly moved backward.  I yelled to both my girlfriend and her friend to look into the sky and they were immediately taken aback by the occurrence as well.  My girlfriend took a picture on her Iphone and the figures&rsquo; arrowhead formation is unmistakeable.They flew out of view to the northeast and another object of the same description emerged from the southwest.  This object, too, flowed very smoothly but seemed to have slowed down more than the other three and stay suspended for a longer period of time; about two seconds.  It was difficult to see how large the objects were because they were so far away but they were about the size of a penny on its side at arm&rsquo;s length.  After the fourth object hesitated, it followed the other three objects out of sight to the northeast. The other two witnesses and I are typically very skeptical of UFO&rsquo;s, however, there is no denying that we witnessed something incredibly bizarre. We are at the top of our classes in the colleges we attend; the University of Maine and the University of North Carolina and were sober at the time of the sighting. I understand that the Southern Delta Aquarids Meteor Shower takes place at this time, but meteors typically flash quickly, fly at the same pace in one direction and disappear.  That was not the case, here."],

I have over 5000 still pics of these objects. I have compiles them into a few video compilations and I have posted them on you tube. I AM A 48 YEAR OLD MALE. I do not prank and I take what I am getting pictures of very seriously. My channel on &quot;you tube&quot; is called &quot;botifigus&quot; if you would rather not click on the links that i have provided.http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bIdHWdV3D2M http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hUDIsVH2HJ4 http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HHzJKnNRkUo  there about 11 video compilations in all, these were all captured in the month of July, 2010.They were all captured at night. Upon hearing you on Coast to Coast last night.  it seems as though pranks are an issue and a pain in the neck for your organization. I would think that it would be. As you don&apos;t want to be pranked, I do not want my intellect insulted.  I filed a report with MUFON and must say I was embarrassed for that organization for its lack of integrity.  The investigator made contact with me via the phone having never even looked at the pictures that I submitted. If you initiate an investigation please at least view what I am offering before contacting me, or please do not contact me. I am also not inclined to listen to the &quot;satellite or other heavenly bodies meme&quot;.  Satellites and other heavenly bodies do not get within 2500 feet of one&apos;s home.  Lastly , if there is no interest in what I have photographed that is understandable.  Again there is much to more elaborate on these things and will should you be interested."],

        "description":["Yellow ball of light following a commercial airliner.At approximately 9:20 p.m. on July 25, 2010, in El Paso, TX, I was on my apartment balcony observing an incoming commercial airliner flying from the east to west as it was making a descent to land at our local airport.  The night sky was clear, other than the clouds in the north. It is difficult to judge the airplane&apos;s altitude, though I could see its underside in detail.  As the plane flew directly above my apartment complex, I noticed a yellow ball of light dart into a position behind the plane&apos;s tail where it began to follow the plane for about 4 seconds.The ball of light was about the size of the airplane&apos;s tail section.  The light did not seem to produce a noise, though it was difficult to know since I could only hear the sound of the plane&apos;s engines.  After it trailed the plane for a short time, the ball of light veered off in a northerly direction, and at times flew erraticly (suddenly slowing down, then speeding up). I estimate the light was traveling at least twice as fast as the plane.I continued to track the ball of light until it faded into the clouds in the north.  It was obvious to me that this ball of light was not another airplane, considering it was not displaying blinking lights, nor was it at a safe distance between the plane I was observing. This incident has great significance to me, especially having read about the increase in &quot;fireball&quot; reports recently."],

However , I must admit that I felt slightly ridiculed as someone had written his own evaluation of what I saw on that report by  adding the following lie to it &quot; possibly Jupiter in the southern sky&quot; .  The trees where the UfO was silently floating are  30 ft away from my house!  One cannot put a planet in those trees!  The ufo was directly behind the trees, moving and changing its appearance. I saw the perfectly bright lights in detail and its pulsating lights.  Planets do not move, display lights and change appearance.  This was a moving object not  Jupiter.  I feel slightly insulted by this odd addition to my Report. It should not be there.     Best, ((END ADDENDUM))((NUFORC Note:  The witness may be correct, but we believe it is the rare UFO that hangs around for an hour and a half.  PD))"],

It came from nowhere and made a horizontal line across the sky in one second then stopped for five seconds.  During that five second moment it flashed two very bright white lights, then took off directly up towards space.  We waited outside for the next ten minutes and saw nothing more.  The speed it was moving at was amazingly fast, with no sound ever and was oval in shape.When we saw the UFO, we thought it might be another meteor at first, but it didn&apos;t descend down to earth.  We were both already looking in the direction from which it appeared at, because we were gazing at the full moon.

        "description":["2nd incident since July 16th, slow streaking object on the 25th, erratic movement on the 16th.Drving from Bozeman to Belgrade.  I saw something streak north in the sky; I thought I was seeing a shooting star (I have only seen about 4-5 in my lifetime), but then it went behind clouds, and I could see it partially obscured by the clouds, and continue in a straight, maybe barely arcing path.There was no accompanying roar as if it was a plane or jet, and it was not as fast as a shooting star, but faster than any plane I have seen.  My roommate was in the car (passenger seat), but he did not see anything, and I kept asking him if he saw it, and he said no.  It was only one object I saw.I grew up around the space center in Clear Lake, Texas, and have seen shuttle launches in Florida when I was a kid, and my best description is if a shooting star had a bit of a trail that disappeared as soon as it was made.  It was traveling South to North, and was too bright and constant to be a star, along with being too big.  It flew just behind some clouds, continued on and then disappeared.I do not know what to make of this, but this is not the first time I have seen something weird in the sky here in Montana.  I Arrived in Bozeman December 23rd, 2009, and last Friday (July 16th) I saw a very strange object in the sky that I mistook for a star, until it moved, leading me to believe it was a plane, but then it moved in very tight curves and zig-zagged.  After about 1 minute it disappeared, but then I could only see it with peripheral vision, and could not observe it if I looked directly at it.  My roommate was outside with me as well, and witnessed and confirmed the object, it&apos;s movement, and then it only being observable with peripheral vision.After tonight&apos;s incident, I checked online for other stuff like that, and came across your website.  I do not like UFO phenomenon, and honestly I am a bit shaken by these two incidents.  I have never witnessed anything like it, with excetion to shooting stars, that DO NOT look like what I saw."],

I went and got my binoculars and when we looked through them I was amazed to see it had strange shape wings and a upper fuselage with what look like 4 engines on the tail.  All this was in the inverted position like it wanted to land some where.  I call for my son to view this and he also wittiness this.  I watched this for 10 to 15 minutes, then craft went up at least 2000ft and then started moving to the north west as it picked up speed.  The craft seem to be in the 40 to 50 ft range; tall. I could tell because it was fairly close to the TV towers, each painted section is 100 ft so I could gauge this a bit.  After this was over I&apos;m sure others saw this since we live in North Oklahoma City.  Also there was no enging noise, the craft was a matt black as best i could tell.

        "description":["Circular crafts blinking red, yellow, orange, green, and blueMy husband and I had just got done watching a movie when we decided to go out to our apartments pond area.  It has a nice open space where the stars are visible with a picnic area that you can sit at.  We went out wanting to enjoy the nice weather and have a romantic ending to our night.  It was around midnight when we went, walked to the back of the pond and sat down.  We where there for aproximately 10 minutes when I looked up saw something circular blinking in the sky.The object was towards the south of us flying lower than an airplane would, and it was blinking red, green, orange, blue and yellow, something an airplane would not do.  I urged my husband to look at it, and he agreed that it was not a plane.  The object was not moving at all, as if it where hovering.  We both at the time just kind of blew it off a bit,joked about it being a UFO we lit a cigarette, and looked up and it was gone.  This is when we began to freak out and get real serious about it, realizing that we where talking about it and observing it for at least 10 minutes without it moving, and then it just disappeared.We continued to scan the sky when I noticed the same looking object to the west of us.  Appearing about 5 minutes after the other one dissapeared.  It had the same blinking colors, only the distance seemed closer, and lower than before.  We kept watching it hover in place, shift to the left and right real fast, and then at moments it would stop flashing colors and turn a yellow-orange color.  It also would get distant and then come closer.  My husband then noticed to the north another one, by this time I am really freaking out, and almost in tears because I cant believe my eyes.  My husband on the other hand excited about what he is seeing.  My husband watched the one towards the north as I watched the one to the west.  We would report back and forth to eachother what they where doing as we watched.  My UFO then shifts right then zooms left leaving a trail of light behind it then dissapears in a split second.  If i would have blinked I would have missed it! Im still not sure where it d! issapeared to.Since the UFO I was staring at had disappeared we both continued to watch my husbands, which was not moving at all.  It was just flashing red, orange, green, blue, and yellow.  I looked over in the direction where the one I was observing disappeared, and it reappeared!  They where both there in the sky again, one to the north, and one to the west.  The one that I was watching seemed as if it would get distant, and then come closer, contunuing to shift right to left and up to down.  My husbands seemed to stay in the same spot not getting closer or farther.  As we observed them seperately we would continue to report back and forth to eachother what they where doing.This all came to an end at about 2:40 p.m. when all the sudden mine turned yellow-orange, then his did too.  Then mine started blinking colors, then his did too.  Then all the sudden both of them began to get distant and higher extremely fast together(still in their seperate directions of west and north), then they both just disappeared.   We stayed until 3:00 to see if they would come back, but they didnt, so we walked to our apartment.From what we collected and witnessed, it seemed as if the two crafts where comunicating back and forth with their lights because one would blink lots of colors then turn to a yellow-orange color, then the other would do the same.   And it also seemed as if the one I was watching was on a mission, as the other one was on the lookout.   We collected this because mine was doing all the moving and his was just still.I had a very hard time getting to sleep after having experienced this.  My husband was very excited about our experience, and was releived that he now knows life on other planets exist.  He seemed pretty calm about it, but still said that he was a little freaked out.  I have never been a believer in aliens and UFOs, but I now honestly have to say, that after experiencing this, I am a believer.  Nothing could explain or justify what we saw.((NUFORC Note:  Possible twinkling star, or celestial body, perhaps?  PD))"],

        "description":["Slow moving silent black triangle craft observed over Nansen Park Lake Oswego OregonOccurred :  7/24/2010 11:45pm Submitted to NUFORC By:  Cameron Johnson, Director of the Oregon UFO Review 2 (OUFOR2)  Reported:  7/28/2010 10:35 am Posted:  8/4/2010 Location:  Portland, OR ( Mountain Park area ) Shape:  Triangle Duration: 2 minutes Large silent black triangle coming from the west and traveling towards the northeast.I received this report through the online report form on this site.  I have met with the witness who wishes to remain anonymous due to his position as a doctor in the community.  The witness was very adamant that he saw what he described and seemed like a very level headed man.  This is a preliminary report on this sighting and there will be follow ups posted as more information becomes available to the OUFOR2.  Below is the information from the online sighting report.Date of sighting: 7/24/2010  Event time: 11:45pm  Event duration: 2 minutes  Altitude of craft: 500 to 1000 feet  Approximate size of craft: 100 to 200 feet across the flat sides ( Equilateral triangle)   (Weather conditions added by OUFOR2 after researching)  Weather conditions: Clear skies, moon lit night.State: Oregon  Country: USA  Zip Code: 97219 (Mountain Park area of Portland )   Number of witnesses to the event: 1  Shape of craft if any: Triangular  Number of craft seen: 1  FFull sighting description from witness statement:  I was walking my dog out to do his nightly business in the park near my home (Nansen Park ) and while I was waiting for him to finish up I caught sight of something out of the corner of my left eye to the west of me and turned to look.  I saw 3 whitish lights moving towards me ( to the east ) at what I thought was about 500 to 1000 feet in the air. As it drew closer I was able to make out the crafts shape as triangular in fashion. It drifted slowly over head and away to the northeast and seemed to speed up the further it got from me until it was gone. There was no sound that I could hear and my dog did not react to it at all. I would like to know what this may have been, but, due to my being a doctor I request to be kept anonymous in the public eye.Contact info withheld by request of the witness.Initial findings:  I met with the witness on 7/28/2010 in the park and asked him a barrage of the usual questions and from first impressions I found him to be a stable intelligent man without an agenda or any obvious deceptive statements.  He seemed truly perplexed and concerned about the sighting and was not making any rash statements about it being an alien craft or a craft of known origins. He seemed fairly savvy on the local ( usual ) air traffic in his neighborhood too.  He did repeat several times that &ldquo; It was like nothing I have every seen before. The OUFOR2 will be conducting further checks with the FAA at the PDX tower and also by contacting the Oregon Air National Guard at PDX as well. OUFOR2 has already checked the weather conditions for the sighting date and has confirmed that the witnesses statement and the official weather conditions match.Shown below are views of the location via map and also forensic models built to illustrate the witnesses sighting.  The witness has viewed the forensic reconstruction models and has agreed that they closely represent what he viewed that night. There has been added detail to the forensic model from information that the witness expounded upon during our interview.  These models are NOT 100% accurate as to what may have been witnessed since there was only one witness and no photographs or videos taken."],

Looks to be stationary at times, then continues to move very slowly, then it disappears.   The distance traveled is about the width of your little finger held up at arms length and the time is around 5 minutes.The unusual part is that it sometimes appears to be 2-3 bright lights and it pulses different colors; almost like an array of colors, red, yellow/amber, green, blue, white.  I wouldn&rsquo;t say that it blinks, but it is more of a pulsing bright to less bright, all the while changing colors.

The object was bright and was flashing red and green lights along with an almost L.E.D. white light. These lights were clearly visible to all three of us using just our eyes and later confirmed with binoculars and telescope. The object almost appeared to be rotating at high speeds which could explain to alternation of lights which had no apparent pattern. This object was relatively fixed in the same portion of the night sky compared to other celestial objects. The object would move in irrative movements, suddenly going to the left and right really fast and then in circular movements. Then, it stopped moving and the green and red lights settled down. I flashed a bright HID light at it in sequences of 3. It was like the object was reacting to my flashes by beginning to move again and flashing back once again. I couldn&apos;t believe what I was! seeing and neither could my astronomy buddies, we were all stunned.((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.

We also noticed a red blink, which led us to initially believe it might be a VERY high flying plane.  Again, the light zig zagged from its path, then fell back into line.From the time we began watching it from about the middle of the dome of the sky to our left horizon, the light took less than a minute to cross the sky (much, much more quickly than other planes in the sky at much lower altitudes.)

The night sky was clear with a full-moon; a balmy evening with excellent visibility and no clouds.I&rsquo;m on the top-floor of a 4 story building; the object appeared below the elevation of the Space Needle, and appeared to be centered over the Elliott Bay area, due west of downtown Seattle&hellip;.approx. 10-15 degrees west of the Space Needle.I watched it for a few minutes, still not sure what I was seeing.  I thought maybe it was a plastic bag&hellip;caught in a thermal&hellip;but the movement was different:  it appeared to undulate&hellip;.&ldquo;wobble&rdquo;&hellip;..and moving slightly in a slip/sliding motion.The object made no noise, had no navigation lights, didn&rsquo;t move like a conventional man-made aircraft/rotor-craft&hellip;and appeared to have a faceted/angular body style&hellip;.pentagon-shaped, instead of being disc/saucer-like.I grabbed my camera and tripod, and photographed several shots from my apt. window area.  Despite the camera being secure, some of the imagery showed a blur&hellip;indicating that the object was moving; it wasn&rsquo;t camera shake, etc.I then ran over to the top of the Seattle Center parking garage for a better vantage point.  The garage rooftop has an elevation approx. the same as my own apt&rsquo;s, but the object appeared to be lower in the horizon, still appearing to be over the Elliott Bay area, west downtown Seattle.I took an additional 10 or so shots from this vantage point.  The object finally dipped below a tree-line, obscuring my viewpoint and was no longer observable.I returned home, downloaded the digital files for review.  Successive frames showed movement from the object, because of the blurring it induced.  Again, the camera was on a tripod with a timer being used; there wasn&rsquo;t camera shake induced.  2-3 shots are relatively crisp&hellip;and show the pentagon-shaped body; in others it appears to be almost an &ldquo;upside down hat&ldquo;, with more mass below the &ldquo;brim&ldquo;.  The camera I was using, a Nikon Coolpix 8400 only has a limited zoom range, 24-85mm + tele-zoom, but I was still able to reveal a distinctive body shape.   Given the limited optics, and the relative crispness of a few of the images, I felt I could guesstimate the approximate area of it&rsquo;s hover&hellip;which appeared to again, be over Elliott Bay.((NUFORC Note:  Probably not a UFO, we suspect.  The object may be a plastic bag, or some other object which may have been filled with helium.  PD))"],

I picked up mine to get a closer look, and lo and behold, there was a group of lights hovering over the ocean.  At first we thought it was probably a cargo ship, but the lights were way too high for a ship.  There were a group of 5 lights; one red, three yellowish and one yellowish-white.  All of a sudden the lights began to change shape, from triangle to rectangle and then back to triangle again.  The yellowish-white light was below the others and moving back and forth over the water. None were blinking, just hovering and forming triangle and rectangle shapes.  After a while it drifted north and the lights began to dim and it slowly disappeared.  It lasted for about 20 minutes.

There was a plane in the sky, far away enough to just look like a white spot, but close enough to see it&apos;s lights, red and white I think.  And it was leaving a white trail behind it, like normal planes do. It looked like a typical commercial aircraft.  But below it, there was another object.  It looked like a white spot in the sky. It had no lights at all, and it wasn&apos;t leaving any kind of trail behind it, yet it was keeping up the same exact speed as the plane.  We watched it for awhile trying to decide what we were looking at, and eventually I decided to run inside and get my camera.  By the time I got back outside, the UFO was in front of the plane quite a bit, and too difficult to locate through the lens of my camera. We never got a good shot.This reminded me of another sighting I had witnessed a week or so before.It was in the same area of the sky, and also in broad daylight.  Again, I was on the porch smoking, and a small flash in the sky caught my eye.  When I looked up, there was nothing there. I watched for awhile to see what might have caused it, and a couple seconds later I saw it again, what it looked like to me was something (that I couldn&apos;t see) was reflecting the sun.  That&apos;s all it was, a bright white reflection that lasted a few seconds.  Disappeared, Re-appeared, and then was gone. I wasn&apos;t looking through a window, or anything, so I don&apos;t know what was reflecting the sunlight, but there was very obviously something up there.A few nights after that incident, my husband and I heard a helicopter really loud outside our house, he went to see, but I stayed in front of the TV..  He explained he saw what looked like a military helicopter, because of it&apos;s green color, flying around the vicinity of our house.  The strange thing though, is that it had a search light on, and instead of searching the ground, it was searching the sky.All of these things happened just within the past 2 weeks. I decided it was one two many incidents to not mention anything."],

Almost full moon and clear night- little clouds in the sky.  Looked up with my daughter and asked her if she saw the lights and she agreed- we saw 3 red/amber lights in a row, no sound coming from them, maybe a flicker, but not blinking- then one by one they went out- in a row.  About 10 minutes later I  saw them in about the same position in the sky and they appeared to come on one by one and then go out one by one- a total of 3 lights.  Again, no sound, no continued blinking like a helicopter or a plane would make- silent.  I called my family outside- 4 more adults and 6 more kids.  In about 10 minutes we again saw the row of red/amber lights- 4 lights this time come on in silence and then go out- my dad said&quot; well that was a circular shape&quot;.  Everyone started screaming and was very excited.  10 minutes later we saw it for the final time a little bit further no! rth or to our left.  Caught it on  video film this time- same amber lights- no blinking, just on and then off, one at a time.  Everyone agreed it was not an aircraft, flare or fireworks- no smoke, no sound, no &quot;falling flames&quot;- just the lights in the sky.  Stayed outside for another 30 minutes and didn&apos;t see them any more.  Will have to submit video when we get home and I have time to download it."],

It was as if I was looking at the bottom of the craft.  I watched this craft for 40 minutes.  This craft was huge.  I have been seeing a great increase in crafts over Mingus Mountain and have calls from other neighbors and friends of what they are seeing as well.  I have been watching this activity for years.  With this particular craft it has been by far the largest one I have seen. What this craft did was move up and down and just hover there.  There is no way possible that no one else could have missed this since there is a freeway there.  It was extremely low and stayed there for a long time.((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.  Date may be flawed.

I stepped outside onto my back porch at roughly 12:30am.  The sky was perfectly crystal clear and their was a 3/4 moon.  The object I saw was first thought to be a cloud.  But I thought it was very strange becaue it was so tiny compared to any other cloud I had seen.  The object was far in the distance.  I would estimate at roughly 5 or 6 miles away.  Regardless of me thinking it was strange, I still just thought it was a cloud especially considering it was greyish in color.  It stood absolutely still in the sky.  I had the moon that was about a fist&apos;s length away as a good landmark for reference.  I quickly went into my house for maybe 20 seconds to grab my binoculars which were right by the door.  I turn around and look out and the object is gone.  This is what made me decide it was not a cloud.  This fact combined with that it was not moving.  I figured a cloud doesnt just disappear in less than 20 seconds and it definitely wouldnt have moved out of sight in that time considering it didnt appear to be moving in the first place.  I was a bit spooked at this sighting and still sort of am but I am excited nonetheless."],

Sometime between 9 pm and 10 pm, my sister and I were sitting side by side on the second floor porch of our beach house looking towards the ocean when we saw one small reddish, slightly orange light appear out of nowhere.  It reminded in the sky for a few seconds, then disappeared; poof it was gone.  Brief seconds later it reappeared in the same place then suddenly become two and moved apart slightly, then disappeared: poof gone.Brief seconds later the single light reappeared and then quickly blinked out.  There was no sound.  They seemed very far away  The lights were not the same red as lights on airplanes or helicopters.  My sister is in her mid- 40&apos;s, very intelligent, very down to earth.  I was surprised when she said, &quot; I saw them too.&quot;  2.  Later, after 10 pm, my two sons (14 and 17) and my brother (early 40&apos;s) were sitting on the same 2nd floor porch looking towards the ocean.  My son (17) saw a large, saucer-ish shaped object, about the size of the moon only not the moon, not round, not white, but red on the outside, fading into bright yellow on the inside.It appeared out of nowhere. It slowly (but still in brief seconds) moved to the left and remained there for 2 seconds.  It slowly (but still in brief seconds) separated in 5 objects, reddish orange in color, saucer-ish shape.  but smaller than the original mass.  It was as though the large saucer-ish shaped light was covering the 5 smaller masses and it disappeared to uncover the 5 smaller things.  Then they disappeared from the outside in: they went from 5 to 3 to 1 to none.  My son (14) had the impression of a red light that &quot; looked sort of like fire&quot; that &quot; looked like it sort of came in&quot; and then &quot; went out.&quot;   My brother was not looking in the same direction and missed all of this because happened so quickly.  My sons both have good heads on their shoulders as far as I know.  My brother is ultra logical.  I was down stairs.  My sons came and got me and I went back up to the porch.3.  Now my 2 sons and my brother and I are sitting on the 2nd floor porch (between 10:30pm and 11pm), raptly studying the sky over the ocean.  After about 30 min. suddenly a large (moon sized) saucer-ish object came out of absolutely nowhere.  It was the reddish, orange color. No sound. It seemed to have movement, as thought it was vibrating or something.  It was there for seconds and then POOF! it was gone.  We were all amazed.I have seen 2 maybe 3 things in the sky that I cannot explain during my life.  I&apos;m 51.  I am open, but also try to be a critical thinker and question everything.  I would not mistake the moon or the planet Venus for an alien craft or a manmade craft!"],

        "description":["Unexplained lights and movement were spotted in the sky above my friends house.Some friends and I were sitting on a trampoline and we were looking towards the church across the street from the house.  I noticed that at the top of a nearby tree there was a blinking light. As I studied it closer I saw red, blue, white, green, and orange lights flickering very quickly. It reminded me of a sign you would see in a store to grab peoples attention.  I showed my friends to confirm what I saw and they started finding more of these objects.  There was the main one (we called it the big one) above the tree, then, we started spotting one over lower trees to the right (we called it the right one). Then, one popped up in-between those two (we called it the middle one), and eventually one showed up underneath the big one. Now, my friends claimed to see very small ones surrounding them sometimes diving, flying around or &ldquo;attacking&rdquo; the main ones.  A few times we saw what looked like large bright shooting stars shoot down from them but it didn&rsquo;t shoot acro! ss the sky, it quickly fell, seeming as if it may have fell to the ground.  We also saw beams of light across the sky often appearing to be blue. There was also this area that we called &ldquo;the group&rdquo; because it looked like a cluster of dim, glowing lights.I am sure these could not have been planes because we watched for hours and the objects were still in the sky around 6 o&rsquo;clock am.  Planes go over our area frequently and the lights and slow speed were just a few things to prove they weren&rsquo;t. It was truly one of the most intriguing, weird, and exciting things I&rsquo;ve ever seen. Also, I forgot to mention that the lights seemed to arrange in trianles at times"],

Once focused on the object I noticed it was slightly glowing but I only really saw it because the moon was so bright. It was traveling north to south and only through the moonlight did i notice it also had a tail. To be honest it moved just like a meteor but it was so close i could actually see the object. It was bulky in shape almost cubed and left a trail but not a light trail like a meteor it was almost like a smoke trail like a plane would leave but it disappeared very quickly. It looked more like it was just moving so fast it was displacing the atmosphere around it. I would have said it was a meteor but I saw that low flying meteor that passed through the atmosphere back in late &apos;09 and it lit up the entire! sky so I don&apos;t believe that this was the same case. This was a big chunk of something that darted across the sky almost invisible.

This &ldquo;star&rdquo; (first being spotted WNW) began moving west at a very slow rate and becoming more orange as it furthered itself in the distance.  At roughly 11:15pm we got out of the lake and I went to see if I could still see the star, I could barely see it.  In the time it took me to walk 15 feet back to my girlfriend, I looked back in the sky and there was what looked to be a fireball in the sky.  It was NNW in the sky and roughly a 45/50 degree angle off the water, about 40 times the size as the brightest star in the sky.This fireball was incredibly bright, with a yellowish color.  We had talked about how it was weird and possibly a plane.  I looked at my girlfriend, made another statement and looked back and there was a second fireball (about 25 times the size of the brightest star in the sky).  These lights hovered in the same exact spot for about 8 minutes or so.  One began to move while the other stayed stationary. The first fireball moved directly north, then directly east and looked exactly like a plane, then began to take a square shape and continue moving east.  The second fireball remained in place for about 5 more minutes and was still in the same position when we left.I&rsquo;ve lived on Lake Erie my whole life and I have seen orange orbs that seem to be unexplainable. Objects moving far faster than a plane would move.  However I haven&rsquo;t seen anything like this before. I was blown away when I used google.com and saw others were talking about this fireball in the sky.  I hope my information has helped and I will be sure to post any further sightings I see."],

The moon was located in the south,venus was setting to the west.  Showed her venus through the telescope.  Above venus was another &quot;star&quot; which although rather high in the sky i thought could have been Jupiter.  When i found the object in the telescope, i could not focus on the center disc.  I also noticed several &quot;sparks&quot; which could have passed for Jupiters moons.  Again i could not focus on the center disc. I showed my wife,claiming it was Jupiter.  One of the sparks was red and one was a pale blue.There appeared to be a haze from the main disc that passed through the sparks.  When i looked again into the eyepiece after about 2 minutes i saw the &quot;star&quot; explode and emit sparks.  I also saw the sparks tumbling away from the disc.  Before this explosion the only objects in the sky were the moon,venus and the mystery star.After the explosion the &quot;star&quot; was gone.((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.

I got my iPhone G3 out to snap a few photos of it.  At first I thought that I was picking up street lights or just a bad picture, that after a few more photos taken, and noticing there were no street lights or what not, I noticed there were two more bright nion red lights next to the moon.  My husband wasn&apos;t amused until he said &quot;let me see if I can take a steady photo for you, i&apos;m sure it&apos;s nothing.&quot;  Than he took a few photos and looked at them and said &quot; whoa, that is weird!&quot; and handed me my phone back.  There were now three objects accross from the moon and in a perfect triangle.  The objects were also in triangle shapes as well the looked similar to this {^} and had red lights at the top of the point.  In the last picture my husband took you can see that one of them looks like its in motion, it just blows our minds, as to all who have seen the pictures.It was not noticable to the naked eye, I captured along with the moon what appeared to be in the first photo a red line next to the moon, in the second photo it was two triangular lights and the moon but and if looking closely at the moon it almost looks like another moon or circular something next to it, with a third red triangle appearing.  What is it?  I googled extraterrestrial images and ufo&apos;s after looking at the photos again and again leaving me in curiosity and concussion.  It looks Just like the triangle UFO sighting found at one time.((NUFORC Note:  We have amended the time of the sighting, in order to reflect an early morning sighting.  PD))"],

        "description":["Rotating, dark gray, rectangles I saw during the DAY!This morning at 9:03 AM, I saw in the bright, blue sky, what appeared to be a dark gray rectangle flying across the eastern sky.  It was faintly dark gray and was spinning so it looked like a rectangle building block being thrown and spinning. It spun and flew slowly for about 9, 10 seconds.  I was watching this from my balcony so I had a very clear view.  It was spinning to look as if someone had thrown a very big, very far rectangle and it was actually going very fast and I would be able to tell if I was way closer.Then all of the sudden, it stopped spinning, it was still flying for 3 seconds, then stopped flying also. Since it was sitting there just still and obvious for a couple seconds I wanted to grab my low power telescope as soon as possible. So I got my telescope and came back out.  It was still in this position. So I looked at it through my telescope, and all I saw was the same big gray rectangle but, this magnified, I could see that one corner of it (the top right corner) had a bent, broken off part. I zoomed in and out and if I zoomed out slightly, I couldn&apos;t see the broken off part. It just looked like the rectangle I saw without the telescope.  But through the telescope, as zoomed in as I could possibly get, I could see the faintest yellowish glow around the edges of the rectangle.  There were no sounds or rumbles whatsoever coming from said rectangle(s). Nor any lights.  Just dark gray.I know it had to be something far, far off in the night sky and not some kind of bag or weird toy (they&apos;re making all kinds of weird, powerful kids&apos; toys these days) because even through my telescope it was still far and fuzzy.  And I&apos;ve easily looked at Jupiter through my telescope before.After putting my telescope back down on a chair, I looked back up in the sky and it was gone... poof... just... gone. Very frustrated, I stayed on the balcony looking at the sky. The same thing came again, appearing over some nearby buildings.  But this one (or the same one?) was not spinning, just flying through the sky very slowly. I looked at this one through my telescope and saw nothing.  Not one thing!  So I looked up and it was gone, again.  Weird?  A little creepy.[Conditions at this time were 84*F outside and no clouds in view during this sighting]"],

It appears suspended/fixed for about 3-4 minutes at a time, then continues to move slowly, further west. I have been keeping an eye on it, trying to discredit this object as a mere, bright star or a planet (Venus perhaps).   Last night, 7/20/10, this object appeared brighter than ever.  It looks just like what an airplane&apos;s headlights would look like at night if it were coming directly at you, however, this object does not appear to move at all.  The curious thing about it is, it twinkles with a barely perceptible reddish hue. It will also dim to the point of being unnoticeable as if a dark cloud were obstructing the view. Interestingly though, there has been little to no cloud cover over the last few days.  I have tried to take video/stills with my phone but my camera does not fare well in low light conditions. But at the same ti! me, my camera cannot pick up any other star in the sky let alone a dot of light.  In conclusion, I can&apos;t discount the fact that planet Venus could be the culprit as I have little experience with astronomy.  But if you were to see how bright this object is, you would most likely say to yourself, &quot;That object is much too bright to be a planet or star.&quot;  I just want someone with experience to take a look at it and prove me wrong.((NUFORC Note:  Venus.

        "description":["Red/Orangeish, or Golden Colored Lights, many appearing then Fading out Together, and being in one place then another instantly,,,I believe the date was around July 20-30th sometime, not sure exactly what date but I believe it was on a Tuesday night though so most likely the 20th.  The time was around 9:30PM - 10:00PM. We were driving to Millen Georgia on I-25 if I remember correctly around Portal when we observed what we believe to be multiple UFOs.  This wasn&apos;t the first time, I had seen a very similar thing close to that area as a child maybe 10-15 years ago.  You can see from the map on this link exactly where the sighting took place between I-16 and Millen somewhere on I-25 heading north from I-16...http://www.flashearth.com/?lat=32.554451&amp;lon=-81.86212&amp;z=10.8&amp;r=0&amp;src=msl  What was seen cannot be described any other way but very ominous, for me anyway.  I was looking straight ahead at the road through the front windshield and didn&apos;t notice anything.  I was in the middle of conversation when my mother, who was driving, said &quot;Hey, is that a UFO?&quot; jokingly.  It was directly in my line of sight however I didn&apos;t seem to see anything until she said something.  When I focused my eyes I began to see Orange/redish or more like golden colored lights in the sky.  Roughly 2 or 3, although she had been looking longer and counted 5 or 6, approximatly 300 to 600 yards high off the ground.  As I had just glanced and only witnessed 2 or 3 for no more than 5-8 seconds, they all simply faded out at the same exact time.  The odd thing is that it couldn&apos;t have been clouds covering them because they all did it simultaneously and they were approximately 2 or 3 miles from each other, spread apart throughout the sky in front of us.My mother claimed that the other ones that I had not seem did the same thing a few seconds earlier.  Then another golden light appeared maybe 2 or 3 minutes later to our front/left.  It was very high up at first and only visible for a few seconds then faded out, far too high to be a light tower.  Then this proccess repeated with no noticeable pattern of timing with only 1 golden light for about the next 10 minutes.  I do some photo minipulation and 3D work for my career so I know distances, angles, and optical illusions very well and this was no illusion.  As we got closer it began to appear lower and lower to the ground, another indication it was not a light tower. It never got under maybe 90 ft from the ground though.  The last time we saw it, it was on the left side of I-25 going north and about 1 mile to the left I believe.  It would disappear, then suddenly appear again in its quite unique golden color for about half a minute or so in different places and appeared to be completely still then it would fade out again.  It was very steady, no pulsing just faded in then out again. I later relayed this info to some family members who live in the area and they said that they had seen some very similar things at other times as well around there. Another interesting detail is that the very next night an extremely severe Lightning storm occurred in that same area. Literally the most severe Electrical Storm I have ever encountered. The thunder was loud enough to cause the entire house to tremble, and it had a sharpness to it that a .44 magnum revolver couldn&apos;t reproduce if it went off right next to your head. I&apos;ve heard that many sightings take place just before or after very severe lightning storms. One of the reasons this was so ominous to me is that I had recently had a dream of seeing a large UFO only a week earlier, which is not a common dream for me. In the dream seeing this UFO was so daunting that it terrified me and I awoke, a dream I&apos;ll not soon forget. On many occasions I have made predictions from my dreams that I discussed with people that later came true, this dream had a similar feeling so I did discuss this with my mother before the sighting took place. In the dream my mother was next to me on my left just as she was during the sighting. I reported this on another website as well, and someone had a very similar sighting with lights of the same color and character only 30-40 miles south of that location in Jesup Georgia just 2 months before. Here&apos;s the site... http://www.ufosnw.com/sighting_reports/2010/jesupga05172010/jesupga05172010.htm((ADDENDUM FROM SOURCE OF REPORT))Just want you to change a detail on the other report i made, change date to 7,20,2010, I was thinking 4th of july, sorry((END ADDENDUM))"],

It covered the whole sky in maybe 4 seconds.  No tail or burn like a meteor but just a bright white orb.  It appeared to be very high.

Further observation with 7 x 35 binoculars showed a pair of identical objects that had red glowing vertical bodies and each with a midway ring with 4 separate green lights, (from our viewing position.).  The objects appeared on the same horizontal plane in what appeared as a stationary position.  After approximately 10 minutes, the Western object&rsquo;s lights faded and the shadow of it&rsquo;s profile could be observed moving rapidly west on the same plane until out of sight.  (It was twilight yet one could still discern the horizon tree line and the moving unlit object.)  After another approximate 5 minutes, the Eastern object&rsquo;s lights faded out and it also moved rapidly west until obscured by what seemed to be clouds.Residing only 40 miles from an international airport, 15 miles from 2 municipal airports and 3 hospital heliports and at least 2 private airfields, during my past 25 years I have witnessed a number of varying aircraft servicing these facilities.The observation of 07/19/10 seems to be an anomaly from what I have previously observed.I have never seen a plane, helicopter, or other flying object turn away at night and not have at least a tail beacon.These had nothing."],

The stars were bright and while I was grilling, I noticed a peculiar light coming over the trees way off in the distance.  At first I noticed the light was staying consistent and not blinking, so I wanted to continue to pay attention to it.   It did not seem to be a light on the front of the object like an airplane; the light did not project in one direction like a high beam on your car either.  It seemed to be illuminating from within.  I told my Fiance and friend to pay attention to it and be quiet so we could listen for the sound of an engine. We heard nothing.  The light seemed to hover very slowly but consistently at first; so I took it to be just way off in the distance and coming directly at us.  But then it seemed to be just a mile or so above us and started &quot;curving&quot; in a different direction. It curved about 90 degrees into a different path. Once it started moving in that direction, it gained an amazing amount of speed and took off until it disappeared.  It never made a sound, even when going into &quot;hyper speed&quot;.  Coincidentally, an airplane passed over our heads within a minute of the object.  It was loud, moving in a straight line, and easily had a distinguishable front and back.The light itself seemed to be small at first.  But then it seemed like it was close to right over us, but the light stayed small. It seemed to be trying to look small.  The light was a very warm glow of orange. It seemed to me that the light was almost coming from the inside of the craft, and illuminating almost in a translucent way. It was very peculiar to say the least. I do not believe in aliens by the way.  I have seen satellites traveling over night skys before, this was not the same thing."],

It wasn&apos;t long, maybe just a few seconds before we both realized this very bright star seemed to be moving.  When we say bright, we mean like venus has been for the last several weeks, just really standing out in the night&apos;s sky.  So the &quot;craft&quot; (obviously can&apos;t call it a star now that it&apos;s moving), began to move upward in relation to it&apos;s neighboring stars then began to get brighter very quickly which we realized was being caused by it moving rapidly in our direction.As it approached I guessed it looked to be no more than 1 mile up, either that or it was a very large craft because as it flew over us we could distinguish individual lights on the body of the craft.  Also I could faintly see that there was a blinking of some sort, however my girlfriend got a much better view as she had run inside and got the binoculars.  She then raced to the north side of the house as it flew overhead and told me a moment later that she was able to clearly see what appeared to be a paramecium shaped craft with rythmically pulsing light from front to back.The craft continued it&apos;s North by Northeasterly course until I could no longer see it. It was extremely bright to me the whole 3 minutes that I was watching it. I have been fascinated by technology and space my whole life and am very familiar with our current abilities as humans in regards to vehicles and propulsion systems.  This craft or vehicle that my girlfriend and I both saw last night in no way compares to anything I have ever seen or heard of that humans can construct. It doesn&apos;t even compare to stretching our most advanced flying vehicles to the point of absurdity.  The reason I say that is the most shocking part of the experience for us:  The Speed of this craft, based on its apparent size, distance and luminosity had to be upwards of 5 or 6 Hundred MPH.  For all of its speed and distance covered, the craft we saw remained COMPLETELY silent.  I mean this thing didn&apos;t make a sound. Not in the distance and not when it was right above us, and it looked like it was over Sacramento 1 minute, then right above us in Nevada City the next, then on it&apos;s way over Nevada the next minute.I am completely certain this craft was not Man Made and I am not a ufo advocate, nor have I ever seen or reported anything like this in my life."],

At approximately 20:55 i noticed a strange looking object in the sky.  I immediately slowed down so i can could get a better view of the object.  At first i thought it was an airplane but it dawned on me, the airport is no where near the location i was at.  I couldn&apos;t get a clear view on the drivers side of my car; so i opened the top on my sunroof to get a better view. When i did the object went from 100 feet west ward (from the drivers side) to 75 feet north; directly above my head, tilted at a 90 degree angle.  The view from my sun roof was crystal clear.  It was a block like disk/saucer.  It had a kaleidoscope of different colors with in each square surrounding the circumference of the craft.  The colors where white, blue, yellow, red and green, it blinked off and on.  There was a tower in the back ground; the lights on the tower stopped blinking when the craft was near.  I stopped my car in front of an apart! ment complex, got out, and before i could take a picture it disappeared.  On my way back home i went down the same street and noticed the lights from the tower where once again operational.((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.

        "description":["stadium sized ship slowly rotated 180 degrees then 5-6 silver balls of light slowly flew out - Desert Center, CAOn Sunday, July 18, 2010, at about 10:00 pm my sister and I were driving on I-10 West near the Desert Center/Rice Road exit.I was driving.  My sister said, &quot;Is that a satellite?&quot; and upon that I look around to see what she&rsquo;s referring to, and suddenly see on her side of the car an enormous flying object that had lights all across the side I was looking at.  As I&rsquo;m trying to drive and also adjust my eyes to the very dark night sky, I start seeing that whatever it is I&rsquo;m looking at is flying at a tilt.  I assumed it was a plane with extra lights along the wings, but then as I keep looking it starts listing upwards and the lights that were on a 45 degree angle on the &quot;wings&quot; suddenly started tilting/listing up into vertical and kept rotating all the way around 180 degrees.  I didn&rsquo;t understand what I was seeing and thought that it was a plane that was crashing into the ground, but it was in such slow motion I just had to pull over.   As I pulled off onto the emergency lane, we saw what appeared to be a saucer/oval shape gigantic ship with lights all around the rim.  When it was tilted I could see that they went all around the rim.  This ship looked to me like it was the size of two football stadiums or so.  That is all I can compare it to.  It was so big and silent.The &quot;ship&quot; looked like it was dark grey or black and the lights around the rim were yellowish. Not plane lights and no green or red or flashing.  There were three distinctly brighter lights on the side I was looking at, one on the left, one in the center, and one at the right side, but there were a few smaller lights. All the lights were glowing in different capacities.  This &quot;ship&quot; seemed to be &quot;landed&quot; after it did the somersaults in slow motion, next to a very dark mountainside.There was no sound from this &quot;ship.&quot;  After a few brief moments we saw the first of five balls of light that slowly floated out from the left side (from my view looking at it) of the ship.  These lights were a silvery ball is the only way I can describe it, but we were at quite a distance from the mountain and where the ship was.  One after another these silver glowing balls came out but at different travel paths.  They were going around the base and midpoint of the mountain slowly but steadily.  The ship that I was looking at slowly had the lights around the rim go dim or something and they were not as prevalent.  The most startling thing was that the ship appeared to disappear.  I&rsquo;m not 100% certain of that as I don&rsquo;t understand how that could happen but from my vantage point it either disappeared or lowered behind land or a hill that I could not see as it was so dark in the desert that night.I was not going to go check out this situation, as my sister and I were traveling alone at night and I started to get nervous being on the side of the road with big rigs going by so I decided that we saw enough of whatever we were looking at and we went on our way to continue on to Marina del Rey, CA where I live.I have not looked into any other sightings or websites or books to see if other people have seen what I saw.  Please let me know if there are other sightings similar to this so I know I&rsquo;m not crazy or making things up that have a good explanation.  Maybe the military is doing something new?  I am a museum director here in Los Angeles and have a very professional and public career and don&rsquo;t really want to share this beyond our discussions together.Thank you."],

And then I get a little interested in that and I look again and I see that it dipped down to where I couldn&apos;t see it.  I kept looking over to glimpse it...I thought I lost it but I kept looking anyway because I kept seeing bits of it through some bushes.About 10 sec pass until I see it again, and it&apos;s fairly low to the ground; it looks like it&apos;s moving quickly so it must be have been somewhat close.  Maybe 50-70 yards away.  So I see it again and it pops up and this time, I saw more lights on it.  Each corner of the triangle had white lights and there are more along the edge that were turning on and off in a random pattern...some would flicker, blue ones flickered, but could have been other colors too.  It was black as the night sky except for the pattern of lights on each edge of the triangle.  And I could see this by the time it swooped up from a lower position.  So it would swoop up and then it would flip or tumble and then swoop very low to the ground.  It would swoop and tumble and traverse through the air while tumbling.  Like it was a black triangle flipping end on end.3 big bright white lights would light up on the edge of it.  And they would get really bright every time it would swoop down.  It would probably be down for 3 sec at a time, then it would go up again and tumble again.  And when it would tumble, it would stay up for about 10 sec at a time just doing random things in the air, flip up over end, go through the air at the same time, looked very random.Dip back down, flatten out...looked triangle the whole time, then it would go down and the 3 white lights would swell and look like head lights.  Then would go back up and other lights would come back on.  It did this about 4 to 5 times that I saw and then I got to the overpass and called my girlfriend to tell her about it...looked behind me on the phone and saw it again.  From that point onward I didn&apos;t see it dip down again.  I took the next off ramp (W Kamm Ave), took the overpass and parked. I could still see it but by that time it looked like a normal plane in the air because of it&apos;s lights.  It traveled away, north, for about 2 minutes until it was out of sight.The most incredible thing about the sight was how close to the ground it would get.  I thought it was landing at times and then it would go up again.  The 3 bright lights that shone down seemed to illuminate the ground, like it was scanning something."],

        "description":["bright string of stationary lights after tornadic storms baffles stormwatcherI was up late as I am a storm enthusiast and we had a tornado watch until 3 am.  I was outside smoking a cigarette and as usual I was looking at the stars between cloud banks.  I was looking due east and about a half a degree south there was a string of bright lights that seemed to blink.  I at first just passed it off as an airliner coming in for landing approach as we are in the direct path of the mpls airport, (about 7 miles to the east southeast). so we see many aircraft on a daily basis.  When I was done with my cigarette I noticed that the lights did not seem to move.  At that point I looked for a point of reference to see if indeed the object was stationary.  I stood against the house and put my arm up at a 45 degree angle and held out my thumb horizontally so the tops of my neighbors oak trees were in sight just below my thumb, the object was an eighth of an inch above my thumb.  I watched it for 40 minutes and it did not move.  It looked like a string of five! stars that were very close together with the second from the left star blacked out.  The lights were so bright that they left a residual light shadow in my sight when i closed my eyes like when you look at a flash and it stays with you for a while after.  I would have watched it all night long if the cloud deck did not block the view.  They were white with a tinge of blue and the left most light seemed brighter than the rest.  The light clouds that would obscure the lights from time to time helped me to see that this was a string of lights as opposed to one bright one.  The clouds are not uniform in their thickness and it would show as they passed how one end would be brighter and the other would be dim and successively the other would get dim and then bright depending on the shape of the cloud. Imagine a 747 about six miles out at 5000 feet coming right at you with landing lights on.  We see this quite often from our front yard.  As It did not move and as the clouds were in front! of it I would have to guestimate that the thing was quite lar! ge and somewhat cigar shaped. side note....not the first ufo I have seen."],

I looked up at the sky and spotted what I thought was a shooting star.  I was very bright and falling very quickly.  It suddenly stopped and started to fade away.  As it faded away, I saw what looked like 3 red lights in a triangle formation.  Then the white lights got very bright again and looked like LED lights.  When lit fully it almost looked like an X, but curved.  It looked far away but very big, probably the size of a large plane.  It moved faster then anything that I could imagine.  I watched it go from one part of the sky to another in seconds.  It continued to fade away and I would see the red lights again and then get very bright white again.  I really can&rsquo;t stress the speed that it was traveling and the size of it.  There is no way that something that large should be able to move that fast.  After 4 minutes I decided to run in and grab my video camera.  I was able to get a! bout 45 seconds of it on film and it does show the speed that the object moved at.  It went up and down and across and zig-zag. I still don&rsquo;t know what exactly I saw, but I do know that there was something physically out there."],

It made absolutely no noise and no fire debris or jet stream was visible from fireball.  My son also witnessed it for approx. 2 minutes.  He took a video on cell phone and I took 1 picture.

They appear in various places and are mostly stationary, however every occasionally they seem to make small circular movements and then return to the original position.  They do not appear in the same place every night.  At first I only noticed one at about 0300.  The next night I saw three.  Since then I have seen different numbers on different nights.  The lights seem to be white primarily but flash to blue and red.I don&rsquo;t have access to a large telescope, but I did watch through a 60x spotting scope.  Through the spotting scope it appears that the red and blue lights are to the side of the white light, not the same light source changing color.  I was unable to see the shape of the object that the lights are coming from.I am police officer who works night shift and I told one of my squad mates about the light the first night I noticed it and he and I both spent about 15-20 minutes watching trying to figure it out.  About a week later the other officer told me that he pointed out the lights to a friend of his and the friend used his telescope (significantly stronger than my spotting scope) and said that he could see a vague shape like a satellite of some sort but couldn&rsquo;t think of any satellite that would be flashing red and blue lights and moving that way.I have also pointed out the lights to my wife, and none of us have been unable to come up with an explanation for these lights that I see every clear night.  Whatever these objects are they are either small or very far away.  Any help would be appreciated.((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.  PD))"],

After dropping my son off I came back and took pictures of the first field.((NUFORC Note:  Photos of fields indicate to us normal &quot;lodging&quot; of grain.  Probably not genuine crop formations.

At approximately 22:00 hrs, people were gathering in the front yard, preparing to leave.  Someone said, &ldquo;Hey, look at that!  What is it?&rdquo;   Everyone (more than 15 people&mdash;adults and children) looked toward the eastern sky to see what it was.  We observed what appeared to be a white light that was moving very strangely.  It would go to the right, then the left, circle and up and down.  It was able to stop abruptly before it changed directions.  I&rsquo;m not sure exactly how far away it was, as there was nothing to accurately gauge it by.  It also appeared to have lights that changed from white to blue to red or purple.  Finally, after about 10 minutes it just seemed to disappear.  I got up the next morning and looked at the local news online to see if anyone had reported seeing this same thing.  No luck there.  However, I searched You Tube to see if by chance anything was there, and! to my surprise there was!  Someone who lives in Spanish Fork, UT, which is about 15-20 miles south of Lehi, UT, had witnessed what appeared to be the same object that we all had witnessed only it had been seen above Spanish Fork about 15 minutes or so earlier.  They did capture this on video; however it&rsquo;s a little shaky but looks to be the same object. .  In the video it also looked to be about the same distance away as when we observed it.  If interested, you can find that video on You Tube titled, &ldquo;Friendly Neighborhood UFO.&rdquo;"],

They were silent and as they moved flew in a zig zag pattern. One went north to south and the other went west to east.  They flew so fast and shot straight up into the sky and then just vanished.  This is not the first time that any of us have witnessed this and many times I have knocked on my neighbors door just so that I could have another witness. I do have pictures of these things and have witnessed them several times.  One of the witnesses used to serve in the millitary, the other witness used to be a sherrif and both have never seen anything like this before.

They were flying slowly together in perfect unison, but in no particular order or shape. At first I thought it was one huge (about 2 football fields long)object, but I THINK they were separate objects...then, after about 2 minutes, they, in no specific order, one-by-one, sometimes two at a time, just disappeared.   They moved so perfectly together and did not sway or waiver at all.   They definitely were not balloons or planes or flares or anything that we&apos;ve ever seen.   They also had to have some sort of silent engines because they were &apos;powered&apos; through the sky.  Made a believer out of me!"],

The object resembled a star, although this particular light was twice as bright as any star in the sky, and the light emitted was not consistent with the other stars in the sky.  The object began to move in various directions (upward, free-fall, diagonal, side to side on a perfectly level plane.)   The craft also had the ability to stop and remain perfectly still in the sky.The craft moved through the sky coming very close to my position.  Throughout the evening I recorded the craft with my iPhone video camera.  While the details of the videos are not recognizable, the movements and lights from the craft are visible on my footage.  To my knowledge, there is no current man-made craft capable of maneuvering like the craft I watched.  What I saw is unlike anything that I have ever experienced in my life.((NUFORC Note:  Venus or Jupiter?  PD))"],

Right behind it came another one that followed it, then a third came from a different direction and disapeared in the same area as the first two.I really have know clue what it was but I have noticed that the past week there has been a lot more activity in the sky at night than I have ever seen before.

At first we thought it was an airplane out of Detroit Metro Airport, but it started to get brighter and then dim again.The longer we watched it the more we realized it was not an airplane.  It was too much like a fireball. It didn&rsquo;t leave any kind of streak or trail.  It was almost like something was burning up while entering the atmosphere.

My sister-in-law was already in the car when I told everyone to look up at the light moving across the sky.  My mother and brother both wear glasses and have poor eye sight but I indicated description and the location of the light in relation to the half moon and light clouds in the sky.  They could not spot it.The light was the size and brightness of an average star you would see in the night sky only it was moving steadily in the blue sky in a westward direction towards Lake Erie.  As I was trying to show my brother where it was it gradually vanished, this could have been from cloud cover but it was clearly visible moving through other clouds near where the Moon was in the sky.  It appears that when I first saw the object, it was flying below the clouds.There was no trail like what you would see from an airplane, the object was high in the sky but appeared to be a white orb or light.  Moving at that speed and distance I would rule out that it was a high flying seagull which would have a different shape and not be as bright.  The weather conditions at the time were clear, no excessive humidity.((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.

        "description":["4 orange flaming lights traveling south to north with 8-9 loud booms, and flashs to the north of our location.At 10:20 PM Saturday 7/17/2010, I was sitting in bed on my laptop online when I heard a loud boom outside.  Fearing someone had hit my car I looked outside to see nothing out of the ordinary, but due to the load nature of this boom I continued to scan my neighborhood.  I then looked up to see that there was a orange ball of light in the sky.  This ball looked to be like fire, but seemed to be in a half circle shape, rounded in the front and trailing off to the back side.  I immediately called my wife to come to the window and take a look, and she came to the window and watch the events with me.The orange light in the sky continued from south to north disappearing behind a few clouds before reemerging from the clouds.  After this light had reached almost the end of our vision another orange light very much same shape as the first appeared to the south tracking about the same direction.Then we heard a boom to the north of our house.  The boom was accompanied by a bright flash that seemed to emanate from ground level, and that was very bright.  This was no fireworks, it was bright white, produced shadowing effects and kind of hurt our eyes.  Then this happened again, I moved to a window I could see farther north from but did not see anything burning nor any explanation for the booms or flashes.My wife then announced to me that another one had appeared to the south same as the first two.  Prior to this one even getting close to our house we heard two more loud booms each accompanied by that same bright flash.  At one point I feared we were under some kind of attack mainly due to the intensity of the booms, and flashes, I dialed 911, as I awaited the dispatcher (placed on hold and transferred once since I called from my cell phone, made this call at 10:30 per my cell phone memory)  I saw another one enter from the south this one on a path south to north but much closer to my house.We heard a total of eight to nine loud booms, and saw a total of four bright orange lights. and witnessed 6 flashes, we were not at the window for all of the booms, got phone for one and was moving to different window for another, and the original boom that made me go to the window was approx 3 booms I had not been looking outside during.The 911 dispatcher told me they had reports of fireworks in the area, but I told him it was not a fireworks display. The light was high enough to be in clouds, and was traveling south to north at a fairly slow pace for something that high in the sky, with the flash and explosions occurring farther north then the orange light in the sky, and the flash appearing to be ground level.During the event my wife and I saw our neighbors come outside pointing into the sky at the lights, with still other neighbors looking out their windows for the origin of the booms. I do intend to talk with them tomorrow, but wanted to file this tonight as the information was fresh on my mind.Although I do not personally believe in Aliens or any such thing, I know today I was witness to something unidentified and flying.  I am not prone to events like this, having worked 10 years as a paramedic and been very scientifically grounded I realize now, that this was something very odd and I am intent to find out what was going on."],

        "description":["3 Lights, 25 Ft. Off The Ground Forming A Triangle Flash In And Out Twice &amp; Then From Afar Coyotes Howl At It For 4-5 MinutesMY UFO TESTIMONY  It was Saturday, July 17, 2010. Me, my girlfriend and her son visited the Bruneau Dunes Observatory in Idaho (between Bruneau and Mountain Home). The staff was there along with us and 20 or so other people. They did not allow us to have on any white lights and the only lights there were the small red reflector type electrically lit lights on the cement. At around 11 PM I was facing what I believe was South East towards the Education Center (look at the map I provide. I think that was the direction) and suddenly out of nowhere, above the building, three white lights with green on the outer parts of the lights flickered for 1 to 2 seconds and then they in a sense &ldquo;turned off&rdquo; like you turn off a light in a room. It just went black. It seemed that even though these lights were like 7 FT. or so above the building, they were actually coming from further away, ahead of us and were probably a lot bigger than what we saw. Keep in mind the building is 10 FT or more in height. I think! I said out loud, &ldquo;What was that?&rdquo; There was a guy on the left of me who saw it too and so did my girlfriend who was on the right side of me. They both clearly confirmed what I saw. We continued to look in that same direction and only a few seconds later the three lights flickered on again for 1-2 seconds and then disappeared. Whatever it was, it did not emit any noise at all. From where I was standing, it looked as if each light was 2 ft. or so in diameter or almost double the size of the moon from where I was standing if I put my thumb up to the moon which was to the right of us almost behind us. They looked size-wise like three double-sized basketball shaped balls of light that were glowing white and green and shook a little bit. There was 1 light on top and two others on the bottom, forming a triangle shape, but I did not see any structure holding it all together. It must have been much further away from us.About a few minutes later, we suddenly started hearing a pack of coyotes a little bit from the left of the building but far ahead of us, over 150 FT or more away making some very nasty howling noises as if they were on the defense against something that upset them. They were howling (right) in the direction of where we saw the 3 lights. Their intense howlings got more intense and nasty for about 4-5 minutes or so. Keep in mind that we never heard the coyotes howl before or after they howled. This only took place after the lights emitted twice and then ended. After that, they went on the coyotes went on and on for 4-5 minutes. I asked one of the staff members who was manning one of the telescopes about it and I told him what the three of us saw. He said to me, &ldquo;What are you guys smoking?&rdquo; Still the young guy in a baseball cap who was about 6 ft. tall and around 27-32 years old saw the lights. Me, I&rsquo;m 35 and my girlfriend is 38. All three of us saw it. We, the three witnesses ! and my girlfriend&rsquo;s son were the last ones to stay at the observatory with the staff. I spoke with the person who gave the presentation in the education center earlier at 9 pm and he didn&rsquo;t act like he didn&rsquo;t believe us but from what it looked like, he had never heard of this before and was startled a bit but very calm and professional. We then went home. It is weird to call this a UFO since as it seems from what I saw it was a &quot;UO&quot; (Unidentified Object) since I nor the other witnesses saw it &quot;fly&quot; or &quot;fly away&quot;. It just blinked in and then out and then the coyote&apos;s flipped out yelling at whatever it was.Some background info you should know: Today, July 19, 2010, I contacted the Bruneau Dunes Observatory and mentioned this situation that happened on Saturday. They were very nice. Apparently this had never happened there before. I asked what was beyond the building. Two people at different times on the phone told me there was 150 FT of mowed green grass. Beyond that is a lake, which they call &ldquo;small lake&rdquo; (people fish there) which is left of &ldquo;big lake&rdquo;. Apparently both lakes combined make up half the size of a football field (300 Acres). With that info and the fact that they said that coyotes are afraid of people and would not be on the 150 ft. of grass behind the buildings, they must have been on the grounds area past the grass and on the surrounding left of &ldquo;small lake&rdquo;. I won&rsquo;t make any assumptions but if I put this info together, it seems to me that whatever this triangular light object was (at least we saw it as triangular from our view) it could have been hovering over ! the lake and it flipped out the coyotes 2 minutes after we saw it and they were yelling at this object for 3-5 minutes. I also contacted Mountain Home Air Force Base that is way on the other side of all this and spoke to them about it. The lady mentioned that they did not hear about any of this and that they do not have any dealings in that area since they are on the complete other side of it (behind where we were standing). Other info I found out is that the observatory is 20 miles south of Mountain Home and 6 miles SW of Bruneau. I believe that is what the lady at the observatory told me.MY GIRLFRIEND&rsquo;S UFO TESTIMONY  It was past 11 PM on July 17, 2010. We were at the Bruneau Dunes Observatory in Idaho. I was lying down on the circular cement seating to the right with my head up looking towards the tree next to the Bruneau Dunes Observatory Education Center. First I saw two round lights. One at the top and one below it to the left of it and it appeared that there was another light behind the branches of the tree on the right. They flickered forward and back for a second, but when they retracted it was very smooth. It looked as if they were on top of the roof but they weren&apos;t. I didn&apos;t know what they were. And then I sat up and asked my boyfriend, &quot;Did you see that?&quot; and he said to me, &quot;What was that about?&quot; and then I saw it again. I saw like three rounded white flickering lights. They were not aligned. I saw one on top and the other one was one across from the other. I said again to my boyfriend, &quot;Did you see that?&quot; and then he said, &quot;(my name), what was that?&quot; And there was a young guy ! sitting opposite from me on the circular cement seating area and he said, &quot;I saw that too. What was that about?&quot;  And then I told my son, &quot;You missed it!&quot; He was sitting in front of me on the cement seating area but was looking in the opposite direction. My boyfriend, the guy and I started talking about what we saw. My son was also with us as we were talking. I thought it was cool but weird since I didn&apos;t know where it came from. My boyfriend said, &quot;I saw three lights and they were kind of green.&quot; And then the guy who also saw it agreed with my boyfriend and said, Yeah, they were green.&quot; I said, &quot;No. The ones I saw, they were white.&quot;  As we were talking, the coyotes started to howl and they angrily started barking, like they saw something. They were on the left side of where the lights flashed. The coyotes were howling for about 4 minutes then stopped.  That was the only time we heard the coyotes that night.After the coyotes stopped howling, my boyfriend told one of the observatory staff members what we saw and then he said to my boyfriend, &quot;What are you smoking?&quot;  Then my boyfriend said to him, &quot;I&apos;m not the only one who saw it?  They saw it too.  My boyfriend pointed at me and the other guy who saw it. Then my boyfriend said to the observatory staff member, &quot;If I&apos;m smoking something, it&apos;s Parliament Ultra Lights and Wallgreens is my supplier.&quot;  The three of us and my son continued talking about it, wondering what were those lights.  We had the question the whole night: &ldquo;What was that?&quot;  And nobody could answer the question about what we saw."],

I&apos;m involved in an aeronautical Institute, currently passed general aviation with a 90 overall getting my a&amp;p license! .  I know aircraft, I witnessed the international space station a few nights ago, I know this subject i witnessed floated in, something wasnt quite right about it, it glowed and floated but moved like.....a laser pointer on the wall... is the only comparison. also witnessed three shooting stars all heading west to east 15 min apart around subject in view. from my viewpoint an airliner flew under subject which helped verify subjects altitude. There are no cities in this area, very wooded area, i may have been the only witness, i watched the sky smoking a cigarette just as subject floated into place. Why is this positioning itself in the sky all night as if it was held in orbit with the earth it moved through sky like a star bright as hell.  I&apos;d witnessed something two weeks ago about 2:30 am walking in a bright light floating towards the house simply vanished as I seen it.  I&apos;m tired of not understanding these happening, and not being believed by anyone. hopefully this helps! someone else with the ongoing question... i will report from ! now on w hat i see now that i live here. there are no neighbor&apos;s and open fields to get a spectacular view of the sky since. thank you this is not a hoax I was very worried when subject moved in the sky, end even more so when it sat in the sky all night, i know the stars the planets and aircraft, and do not understand what els would have done this, i simply got tired and lost site of object with cloud coverage, thank you for listening. maybe you can help me figure out what these are..."],

        "description":["I&apos;m back with another report only this time I&apos;m not confused.I&apos;m a Superintendant of a Residentual Building across the street from the Bronx Supreme Court and one block away from the Yankee Stadium.  My two nephiews and I were walked up to the roof to watch the amount of Yankee fans that came for the Old Timers Game.  Sure enough, as I last stated here back in July of (I think it was 1999), we witnessed them again, the first one appeared to us like fire directly above our heads it just spun around in a circular motion then just disappeared. The second seemed like a star but it was too high up to say anything about it and was moving very rappidly also not in a steady motion.The third was astonishing. It was amazing but we were not surprised due to the fact we saw them before plenty of times just spending time up on roof-tops. It was close to the Supreme Court&apos;s roof just hovering straight across in a very slow-motion.It was an oval egg-shaped like object, about the size of a full-sized van and an orange or fire like color to it with no shine or light, just creeping across the sky.What got us was that about 3 minutes to the direction it headed towards there appeared to be a crime scene.  All of a sudden a Police helicopter flying in circles around the area and about 20 Police cars.Then we saw a fourth heading towards the same direction but this one appeared to be white.   A fifth was coming behind him, this was to the left of us while the other to the right of us.  This one startled us a little because it was very close, seemed to be coming towards us at head level then it rose up at about 50 feet above our heads, this one was very clear to us.  It was definatley oval, saucer like, with two blue lights going around in circles on the top center of it.  The lights were not bright at all, perhaps they weren&apos;t lights.  It then changed shape, seemed like two legs came out the backside of it then it crumbled like liquid metal and again back to it&apos;s solid shape and headed to the same direction as the other four.Five minutes had past and the sixth appeared behind us this time above the Yankee Stadium heading straight towards our direction also at head level and slowly towards the last fives&apos; direction.  Then about two minutes later, five in a V shaped formation headed straight across the sky for about ten seconds and just vanished before our eyes, again towards the same direction as the last six before them.I stopped wrighting to the National Ufo Reporting Center because I wasn&apos;t getting any answers.  I was going through a lot of great disturbing confusion and wanted to point the finger at all the wrong places.  Instead I decided to ask, what ever I was looking at, for answers.  This is all I wanted to share for now, it makes no sence what-so-ever for me to dwell into this because the life experiences I have had lead me to believe and understand that folks all over the world will always be blinded by the truth and wouldn&apos;t believe it if these crafts were pointed out to them.  Yet a large amount of us believe and preach that there is a God but don&apos;t have enough faith to understand the huge fact that heaven is directly above our heads, in space, there are millions of angelic and demonic beings, or just normal like you and I, watching over us or just living their lives out there in different worlds.  We don&apos;t have all the answers as facts because we all need to find faith in order ! to get the answers we want or wait untill we die.  That&apos;s what makes us God&apos;s favorite creation, remember that we are a creation from above.  I searched for many answers during my first experiences and I found many answers with nobody&apos;s help.  There will be a time when they will reveil themselves to us with or without the approval of our so-called-leaders.If you believe what I am saying and search for aswers using faith from God then they have a special place for you."],

At first it looked like a hot air balloon possibly on fire, but then it was moving too fast to be one and looked less like one the closer it got.  There was a darker center to this object.  Size wise, the object would be more comparable to the size of the moon than to any stars from our perspective on Earth and much larger than any meteor I have seen.   It was about the size that a dime looks when extending your arm fully and looking up at it.  It was closer to the ground than a plane would be flying, but higher than a bird would be flying in the sky.  The object was not at all comparable to fireworks, remote controlled airplanes, etc.  It had an orange glow emitting from it which looked almost like fire does, although I could see no flames. It moved toward the Northern sky and disappeared out of sight.  At first the glowing object was stationary but then it started moving.  The flight pattern was mostly horizontal, although it did rise straight up and go straight down twice and it moved diagonally in the sky once.  This all happened in a matter of 30 - 45 seconds if not longer I would guess.  It was much quicker than a plane would be viewed moving in the sky, although it did hesitate a few times.  There were no sounds associated with this.Witness:  I was the only witness to this at my location and did not have a camera or video recorder on me.  I am a 20-something year old college graduate with some emphasis on geology and astronomy.  There are no drugs, alcohol, or mental illnesses involved."],

At first it seemed to be an airplane heading toward nearby John Wayne Airport and even turned in that direction like a normal airplane.  There were no green or red lights, only a single star-like white light.  After turning to the south, the light dimmed and then made an abrupt turn to the north and brightened to about 1 magnitude or brighter.  The object began a series of acrobatic maneuvers that an airplane could not perform.  It reversed direction almost instantly, swooped down very rapidly, and climbed just as quickly.  This pattern of movement continued during the entire episode.  Although the object seemed to stay in one part of the sky, it slowly drifted toward the east and finally disappeared from view.  I watched the object for about 10 minutes.  While observing the strange motions, I saw an early-morning jogger come by and pointed out the object to him.  He joined me in my observations until the object passed from view."],

At first thinking it was lightning I pretty much dismissed it, but as I watched  it changed.  It started fluctuating in light color and brightness as if something was just on the inside of the cloud wall.  As we approached the south side of Spring Hill it was as if a hole opened in the cloud and a bright light shined through it.  It was long and cigar shaped.  As I continued to watch I started to see two of them.  They would go in and out of the cloud as if to use it for cover.  Once we got close to Hillsdale, KS my sister finally was able to catch a view of it.  We eventually pulled over at US Highway 169 and Kansas Highway 68 to watch it.

PD))Four light orbs that disappeared and reappeared in West Chester, OH 7/16/10UFO Sighting July 16, 2010 in West Chester, Ohio   At approximately 9:40pm at XXXX Ridgetop Drive, Cincinnati, OH, I and two friends were walking out of Monster Golf towards the parking lot when to the North, we saw orbs in the sky above a dark, wooded area.These lights were yellow in color and there were 4 of them.  They were all floating in a straight, diagonal line.  Slowly, one by one the lights began to disappear until there was only one left.  Then, the lights all started to reappear one by one until there were 4 again.   All while this pattern was happening, the whole formation was moving downwards.  After watching it for about a minute, it eventually reached down to the earth but we couldn&rsquo;t see it anymore as it was hid by the trees.  Every 5 seconds or so, a faint yellow light was seen behind the trees, as if the UFO had landed.We know it can&rsquo;t be planes or helicopters because planes do not flicker their lights on and off, they do not maintain this weird formation, and there is no runway near this location.  Lantern kites were also ruled out because like I said, they don&rsquo;t just flicker on and off, and they were high in the sky.  We can&rsquo;t explain this unusual event, but I hope I&rsquo;ve given enough information.  A few other witnesses in the parking lot also saw this scene.((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.

The computer is in front of the window.  The window was open.  I noticed a very bright object in the sky. I thought it was a plane on fire, heading towards the ocean.First point of observation  The window faces Southeast and is 3&rsquo;x3&rsquo;.The object moved from E to SE, horizontal with a slight ascending direction, just over the tree top, (tree is about 40&rsquo; high and about 100&rsquo; from window.The shape was cylinder like, (side view of a plane, without the tail, no wings).  Using the size of the window, 3&rsquo;x3&rsquo; as a reference and a piece of tape on the window to represent the object, the tape would be about 1 to 1 1/2  long, and 1/4 wide.The color was  an orange-yellow-red liquid fire and was moving/flowing/changing within the cylinder.  It was very bright,  and had depth, as if you could see into it.  (It did not appear to be a flat surface, but a surface with depth)  There was no glow or halo around it and no trailing tail.  All the light was contained within the cylinder.  No sound.Second point of observation  As the object neared the outer edge of the window, I went outside to continue observation.  (Retraced steps today and it takes approx. 45 secs. to get to where I was standing last night.)  The object was not where I thought it would be, instead, it was stationary and enlarged into a circle. (I thought the plane had exploded.  There was no sound and nothing falling from the circle.)  The light was contained within the circle, there was no halo and it was not as bright as the cylinder light.  There was still movement within the light.  The circle dimmed, brightened, dimmed again and then blinked out.I returned to the house and checked the time:  10:45 PM.Standing in the same place today, I noticed the size of the circle and location of the circle was almost in the same place as the (whole)  Moon was at 5:24 PM today .

While talking, we noticed something in the sky that did not look like a plane.  As it flew closer, we noticed the shape of the object and that it was extremely  quiet.  It didn&rsquo;t make a sound at all and was flying so low that we thought it was going to hit our house.   It was a triangle shape and had a few lights on it.  A white light and two red slow blinking lights. Shortly after this flew out of sight, we noticed another one of these aircrafts flying towards us.  It looked exactly like the other one with all the same descriptions as the last one.  I definitely believed in UFO&rsquo;s before this experience and now I REALLY truly believe there is something out there.((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.

All of sudden it rapidly split from one large light which was vertical with a tail into 4 seperate lights splitting horizontally in the sky.

It was strange because it was a hazy night, and no stars or planets were visible, as it was not a clear enough evening.  Not only was this visible, but it was exceptionally bright.The object was stationary, and high in the sky.  I showed my wife who also thought it was strange, because no stars could be seen, but this could.  I decided to stand on my porch with binoculars and look closer.It was difficult to make out any discernible shape, because the white light was too bright.  But it was just sitting still in the sky.  No aviation lights blinking of any kind.  No detectable movement.  It was definitely not a helicopter, or plane.  I watched commercial planes fly by it, and sometimes under it, on their approach to LAX and Burbank airports.I mad sure not to move my position on my porch, so that I could keep the lights position in perspective against the visual landmarks I was comparing its position too.  It remained still, lined up in the same spot and  not moving. I judged this by relating it&apos;s position to a palm tree, and telephone lines in my line of view.It was hard to judge how far away it was, because I don&apos;t know how big it was.  It definitely wasn&apos;t close by.  I would guess hovering somewhere between Woodland Hills and Malibu, CA, both due west of my location.After about 30 mins I was ready to give up, having decided it simply must be a very bright viewing of Venus or something, when it suddenly (albeit slowly) started moving to the north and further away (out towards the ocean, maybe near Thousand Oaks, CA).I watched closely, and had my wife join me.  She had been checking it&apos;s location from time to time, during the half hour.  She completely agreed that it had moved significantly off the spot it had hovered, completely still in, and was moving away.I felt that it also seemed less bright, and possibly even a slightly orange hue, during its exiting the area.Eventually it was out of our view.  Too far gone.We have no explanation.((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.

        "description":["Close up encounter with an object that was translucent, low luminance, floatingI had already been seeing strange craft in the sky and purchased a camera to document my sightings.  I have pictures of a few of these crafts but not the one that I&apos;m reporting.  I was standing out in my driveway looking up at the night sky. Looking, constantly looking for something unusual.  After about 2 hours of staring at the stars, I finally decided to go back inside my home.  After I walked up to my front door, I opened the storm door and then turned around once more to look into the sky. When I fist noticed it, I wanted to freak out.  There it was an object floating in on a direct path, It didn&apos;t move side to side or volley up and down. It moved as if though it had a mission or purpose. I was nervous, and scared,  So afraid in fact that I could feel my knees buckling. I guess because I didn&apos;t know what to expect and I wanted to act non aggressive. I though that I was either going to be taken, blasted into nothing, or become part of this things menu. So I! wanted whatever or whoever was propelling this thing to know that I am not a threat. As It approached from the North sky,  It floated down into my yard just above the tree in the center of my yard. Then it lowered itself approximately 7 to 10 feet above my head and stopped for approximately 5 to 7 seconds then proceeded forward ascending above my rooftop. As it was leaving I yelled out &quot;What are You.&quot; it never made a sound, not one sound. It was an unusual color.  A low intensity pinkist to violet light, that was almost hypnotic to look at. When I first noticed it all that could be seen was the front. As it came closer I noticed that it&apos;s body was approximately 20 to 30 feet in length. The body looked as if though it was filled with fluid color. It had no wings. the body also had no real width (I mean that it appeared that nothing living could occupy that space). approximately 1 foot in width, but the front was enormous compared to the body 4 to 5 feet in width. There were! windows or slits in the front that were slanted in opposite d! irection s and were also illuminated. As it elevated higher to clear my house and the trees in the back yard its speed never accelerated. I would guess that it&apos;s speed was approximately 10 to 15 miles per hour until it was out of sight. It should also be mentioned that I attempted to get video of all of this, but upon uploading my camera videos to my computer I noticed that I had nothing. I pushed record my battery was charged and had worked with all other encounters, but not this one. After I went inside I told everyone about this encounter.((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.  PD))"],

Before I was able to get my camera turned it moved rapidly to the west and then stopped and vanished.  The sky was cloudless and it was just after sundown.

You could vaguely see the silhouette of a structure that it was attached to.  It would slowly bob across the sky (sort of like a bouncing ball during a sing-a-long broadcast or karaoke-style television program would have used to follow the words).  The shape of the structure was really hard to make out because it was very high in the sky.  But, it moved too quick from left to right or side to side back and forth each way to be something like a star.  As I type this it is still out there.  We are capturing video footage of it!"],

It seemed to have a red light at its core with yellow lights blinking in sequence on the outside.  After a couple of minutes, a second identical light pattern emerged from the first one and began erratic flight patterns around the first one which seemed to stay in the same spot.After performing maneuvers impossible for an aircraft to achieve (moving straight up and down vertically and laterally with the pattern of lights remaining the same), both craft departed in different directions before we lost sight of them in the darkness."],

At this time a bright, blue toned light caught our eyes, in the Eastern sky moving from North to South.  The object was about 10-15 degrees above the eastern horizon.  The object was moving very fast, much faster than a conventional craft and traversed the eastern horizon in about 20 to 30 seconds max.  It was a solid bright light, no blinking lights, no trail, seemed to move a bit erratically on path. I thought at first it could be the ISS, or another prominent satellite but I checked fly overs, times, and directions of fly overs and none of them added up to our sighting.  The only visble fly over at that time and date for my area would be the Genesis II, which would have been to our backs, not ahead of us in the Eastern sky."],

I waited until there was no traffic so I could swerve a little as I stared out the window.   Just as all the cars drove off, I had noticed a upside down triangular object with red pulsating lights going left to right over and over.  A car had sped past me and I had sped up to 110mph to catch up with him and the other cars.  The drivers around me had taken notice as I was able to see their faces off of the interior lighting.They slowed and I seen one pointing, the object began to disappear more and more until it was barely visible then vanished.  A couple of minutes later, there were four air crafts with blinking lights that were floating around where the UFO had traveled.  I noticed one to my left at first then another one was flying toward him underneath.  There was also one ahead of us and above.  This did occur near a airfield but the initial craft that caught my attention was unlike that I had ever seen in person, the pulsating lights left me dumbfounded.((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.

        "description":["VERY large aircraft flying low, slow, and silently.I walked about 20 yards from my semi-rural house to turn on the irrigation to my windbreak trees for the night.  After throwing the valve, I looked up at the night sky and saw an amazing array of lights moving from the southwest to the northeast over our neighbor&rsquo;s alfalfa field, approximately 400 yds away and only 100 to 200 feet off the ground.  Four things struck me at once:  this thing was HUGE, slow, low and absolutely silent.I saw six white lights in a straight horizontal line, plus there was one blinking, smaller red light above the far-right light.  At my relatively close range, I estimated the thing at two to three football fields wide.  I&rsquo;ve never seen anything flying remotely as big as this, in my life, or heard of any plane so large.  The whole array was moving very slowly, maybe 15-30 mph.  I had the feeling I was looking at the trailing edge of a huge wing, or perhaps the edge of a disc.  It moved slowly along its trajectory, headed towards town, where there is an airport.I thought:  &quot;If this is a plane coming in to land, it&rsquo;s gigantic, must be some secret government job, but why is it silent and illegally (and dangerously) low?&quot;  As it moved along,  the bulk of my barn blocked it out, so I walked rapidly to the other side of the barn, towards town, and there it was again, following its course, and I watched it disappear over the hill, with no change in the light array.Very quiet, very low, very slow, VERY large.The next day I told my brother about it, and he told his son, who happened to see the same thing, with eight witnesses, 15 minutes after I did.  My nephew only saw four white lights in horizontal array, and guessed it was two craft flying in formation, but like me, wondered why they were so low, so slow, and dead silent.  He said they seemed to meet up with another, smaller, moving, bluish-colored light, and then turned from their course and moved towards the southeast and that when they did, super-bright lights flashed for an instant, like a prism turning, and then they moved slowly out of sight.I hold ((deleted)) degrees in ((deleted--arts and sciences)), including ((deleted--multiple degrees)) from the University of ((deleted)), and a ((deleted--advanced degree from prestigious overseas university)).   I have never seen anything like this in my life; it took me aback for an instant, but then I rapidly started to catalog and process what I was seeing.  I have an open mind towards unusual phenomena, and believe that the unexplained represents a major frontier for science.For what it&rsquo;s worth, I live within 10 miles of the Hanford Nuclear Reservation, now undergoing cleanup, where eight or nine deactivated plutonium production reactors, and one live power-generating reactor, sit in a row along the Columbia River.  On another front, the first crop circle in the USA occurred within 5 miles of my house, and very near the flight path of whatever it was I saw."],

The weather is clear, and stars are visable.  I thought the stars might be out as it looked like it would be a clear night, so I went out on the porch to look.  I noticed a very bright, white star very low to the earth in the west, it was just above the trees and about 1000 feet away from where I was standing.  It was hovering in one spot over our marsh in the west.  I went to get the binoculars and went down stairs and outside to get a better look at it as stars are never that low.I looked and saw bright lights around it&apos;s rim, it had what could be described as feelers protruding from the edges of it.  It was oval pie shaped and danced in one place, tilting up and then down, like if I held a pie tin oval shaped with a point down and then back up level so the pie would not fall out.  The lights danced and dimmed and brightened.  One bright, white, light beam seemed to be directed my way.I saw the lights change color to red but it was muted in tone, soft like, barely noticeable.  By about 10:25 it no longer showed itself.  The funny thing is the west was totally dark as if no stars in the west at all.I was quite excited to see something so unusual.  I wondered about it.  What is it?  What is it doing over our marsh?  Where did it come from?  Earlier this evening (about 8:00PM) the satellite dish had some interference and did not work.  I called the internet dish company and there was an overload of callers with the same trouble.  I called both the Wausaukee police and the Crivitz police.

I looked over and saw some fairly bright yellow lights in a triangle formation.  They were about the size of airplanes but much higher in the sky and they were only flickering, not blinking.  We pulled the car over to the right side of the road and I grabbed my camera to take a picture but just as a snapped the shot, they moved out of the triangle formation and into a horizontal line and began traveling southward very slowly.  That&apos;s when I switched to video-mode.  I stopped filming after a while because they didn&apos;t seem to be doing anything exciting and I figured they were just going to keep flying at that same slow speed until they made it over the mountains about 12 miles south of us.  We got back on the road and kept driving and immediately saw another light in the other direction (Southern Sky) that was much bigger and brighter than the first three and appeared to be hovering right over the mountains.  We passed by a patch of trees at that point which blocked our view of that second light and I mentioned to my boyfriend that maybe it was just an airplane tower at the top of the hill and that we were just seeing the light on the top of it.  But as soon as we passed all of the trees, that light has disappeared!  This freaked me out and made me wonder if the original ones were still there or had just disappeared too so I turned around to check and I saw them spiral together and disappear!((NUFORC Note:  We are attempting to reach the source of the report, in order to gain more information about the sighting.

The first 1 or 2 we saw we thought  were clouds, but then realized there were many more &amp; they appeared to be descending and moving at the same time.  In looking closer they appeared to look like parachutes. Soon after that, however, we realized that assumption was impossible.  First of all, the objects were traveling at an impossibly fast speed.  Even though we were driving on the freeway, they continued to pull further and further away from us.  Another reason that these objects could not have been parachutes was because they never came close to the ground.  Eventually, it seemed that some split off the the right of the freeway towards our house, and some went to the left of the freeway toward the Van Nuys area.  After we got off the freeway, we started to go up the hill that we live on, and I continued to look for any sign of the objects.  That was when I saw an extremely large hovering, triangular shaped, flat craft above the mountain.  Again, it had no lights, but this time, it was motionless.  When I got home, I looked outside, but at that point, the object was either gone or out of sight."],

It was mostly white with a little trace of red on one side. It was way bigger than any star or planet or plane I had ever seen.  It wasn&rsquo;t blinking, and it didn&rsquo;t appear to be moving.   It stayed in one spot low in the horizon; I&rsquo;d say about twenty five to thirty degrees up.Baffled, I called my husband who was at home fifteen miles away in Springbrook, WI.  I asked him to step outside and tell me what the big object in the sky was.  When he asked me the direction, I replied, &quot;Don&rsquo;t worry, you will know when you see it.&quot;  It only took a few seconds to see what I was talking about. I asked him, &quot;What is it?&quot;  He replied, &quot;I don&rsquo;t know.&quot;When I arrived at home, he was still in our yard watching it through a brake in the tree line.  We watched for about 5 seconds, and then it dipped down and to the right about an inch in a swooping motion.  I gasped, completely shocked, &quot;Did that just move?!?!?!?&quot;  My husband replied, &ldquo;Yeah, it&rsquo;s been moving the whole time.&rdquo;  We stood and watched this thing bounce around and move.  It dipped and dived and moved in small circles, almost as if we were watching someone flying a kite with a light on top of it, a kite you could see 20 miles away, with no wind.  Several times we had to move a few steps left or right because it would move behind the tops of the pine trees.We called our friend Dan who lives 8 miles west of us in Trego, WI.  When he stepped outside, he was stunned. When I was sure that we were not the only ones who could see it. I called 911.  I couldn&rsquo;t be sure that whatever it was, it wasn&rsquo;t dangerous.At about 11:00 it seemed to start heading down in the western horizon and it got gradually smaller, like it was going away from us. At 11:05, we couldn&rsquo;t see it anymore.It was a clear night and we could see hundreds of stars and satellites, and even an airplane flew by.  But none of them moved or looked like this.  I really wish I knew a good solid explanation of what the thing was, and every night, I keep my eyes open to see if it comes back."],

Because of the distance no detail of the object could be seen but it was stationary and the flashing was very bright and had no distinct pattern as it flashed at random.   The object seemed to at first to be moving higher in the sky and drifting I think in what may be North direction. At this time we debated and rationalized that if it could be a Mylar helium balloon and the sun would reflect off of it as it turned creating the bright flash of lights as it turned into the sun that was starting to set in the west.   Then it got a little more interesting as it started moving ( Drifting)  at a more rapid speed in a completely different direction at first moving closer to us and the! n moving what I think was east.  It made no noise had no characteristics of an aircraft that we could define.  We do not know what it was we saw but  if it was in fact a balloon its behavior was indeed unusual and the  brightness of the flashing seemed too strong and bright to be reflective.

        "description":["A fleet of white circular UFOs over Alameda, CA.My wife and I saw a fleet of white circular UFOs flying overhead at around 13,000-15,000 feet over me in formation moving very slowly today, July 11, 2010 at around 16:10 hours.  The formation was more of an long elongated formation.  Some crafts were in a tight formation while other crafts were spread out.  From what I can see, they were too high to be birds and too big to be balloons.  If they were white balloons, they should of been moving south because the wind was blowing from the north this evening at around 10 knots.  This was not a one time occurance in my area.  I usually see one or two during my weekend afternoons when I am usually working on my garden, but never thought of reporting it due to the fact that I don&apos;t know what it is.  But this time it was different, I saw 27-30 of this unusual craft moving overhead and the frequency of siting is increasing.I am at a close proximity to Oakland and San Francisco airport and see many planes of deferent make and sizes flying overhead.  I know what planes or helicopters looks like even at high altitude from the shape of the fuselage and wings.  This crafts exhibited no known feature of known aircrafts.I am a laboratory manager for a small Biotechnology company and have training in science.  My wife is an Executive Assistance for a high technology company.  We both now firmly believe there is crafts of unknown origin flying through our airspace.  I would like to purchase a digital video camera soon to film my experiences so that I can share or present solid evidence to other researchers in this field.  I hope we were not the only people who witnessed this amazing event this evening."],

The object had a translucent faint orange/gold semi v-shaped leading edge and was shaped similar to a flying wing type aircraft only much, much larger with a transparent look to it.  The object moved in a straight line from roughly east to west, making no sound, and traversed the entire visible sky in less than 30 seconds.  I am very familiar with all types of conventional aircraft having been a plane enthusiast for over 30 years, and this object fit no description of anything I have ever seen.   It had no marker lights and was much too large and fast to be any ordinary aircraft.  Its absolutely straight course, translucent appearance and color, and its shape and immense size would discount the possibility of it being a searchlight, reflection, or other easily explainable source."],

Our backyard is pretty dark and we can see all the stars at night.  I looked over to the northwestern skyline an noticed a very bright object hovering but slowly moving to the right and forward and then backward?.  The object was very bright and triangular shaped.  Then disappeared beneath the treeline. About 25-30 minutes later, my husband went out to see if the object had reappeared.  He yelled for me to come out and take a look.  The object was now moving in an unusual eratic almost zigzag form flying southeast.  We noticed 3 redish orange lights and then disappeared.  I have to say we are both feeling quite dumbfounded.  Once the object disappeared from the southwest was what looked to be a star moving in the same direction as the object and then also disappeared.   There was no sound, no lights blinking.  This was not an airplane or helicopter and I&apos;m certain it wasn&apos;t a satellite.  We don&apos;! t have too much knowledge on the unmanned military aircraft which I guess could be a possible.

We all started scanning the sky to see if we could see any and pointed out a few satellites to our friends.  We saw a bright one come from the west to the east and disappear just east of directly overhead. As our friends were getting into their car to leave we saw another light come from the south west headed north. We asked them to hurry up and look because this one was lower in the sky than the others we showed them were.  When the light was west of us for the heck of it I flashed my light at it twice.  I got an immediate response of a flash from this light. It went from a normal star sized light to almost a headlight sized light but very bright.  My wife immediately asked me to try it again and immediately it flashed again.  The time from the first flash to the second was no more than 20 seconds.  It stayed still in that same place for another 5 minutes and then it just vanished.  It was a little lower and west of The Big Dipper.  I never thought I&apos;d get a response from the light.  I just did it for the heck of it.  It flipped everyone out when it responded, not once but twice.  I&apos;d sure like to know what the heck it was."],

        "description":["several flying objects surrounding one bright light that moves in different directions slightlyDear NUFORC, I was awoken last night at about three a.m by my mother and roommate. They asked me to come look outside; that they have seen a UFO. I rolled off the couch and when I looked, there was a bright light, that looked like a star... The problem?  It was moving in circular, diagonal, vertical and horizontal motions.  It is sort of difficult to see, but if stared at long enough it is possible to see the movement.  Also, it seemed to have smaller red dots sort of behind it, but still part of the same craft.  Not only did we see this moving object but we saw a much smaller, and less dim, object come from the larger UFO and fly through the sky and disappear! I cannot even explain the amazement we all shared.Now, tonight, I decided to follow up on what I had seen last night and it is there again! It isn&apos;t even that far over in the sky as it previously was before..  Maybe a foot or so from my point of view. Tonight already I have seen about five flying objects around this light. They fly around it and then seem to disappear out of nowhere.  One my boyfriend pointed out and because before disappearing a blue beam of light shot from it.  Please look into this.. I feel as if my family cannot be the only ones who are witnessing this.P.S my boyfriend, a skeptic beyond all belief, even agreed that there were flying objects and that the white light in the sky was moving! I still remain amazed as I write this letter to you.Sincerely, An Interested Viewer"],

On the way home we stopped by a gas station to get some milk and fuel. After leaving the gas station, about 2 miles west of there we had came over a hill on KY HWY 80 to see a very bright yellow, circular shaped light.Now, we are very accustomed to helicopters from living close to a regional hospital and even closer to the Daniel Boone National Forest. But as we proceeded over the hill, we noticed that the light did not cast a beam, unlike a spotlight. It was also moving at a very slow speed.While we watched the object, we both stated that it was very unordinary. So we rolled down our windows to listen for the chopping of helicopter blades but there was no sound and we were the only car in sight. Then, as the object crossed the highway and was almost directly overhead, the light vanished.I will say that when I encounter some &quot;phenomenon,&quot;  I always step back and try to explain it logically and practical.  I have no explanation no matter how much I try.  With no sound and then vanishing before our eyes, we are at odds.  Thank you for your time."],

There was an unusual swoosh pattern, a large swoosh pattern.  The &ldquo;stars&rdquo; in the swoosh pattern were blinking in a sort of Morse Code way, as if they were talking to each other.  I went outside a few times until almost 2 am and they were still out there.Tonight (7/11) around 9:30pm  I went outside to smoke a cigarette and I saw a bright light above, as I looked up it dimmed greatly and blended in with the stars, that&rsquo;s when I noticed it was moving fast across the sky, too fast to be a plane and too high.  I made my boyfriend come out and look. He also saw it, it went over my house so I did not see where it went.  I watched the sky and off in the distance over the houses across the street I spotted another one, blending in with the stars, I watched it &ndash; every &ldquo;star&rdquo; it passed brightened as it was passing it and dimmed again after it passed, I watched it until it disappeared - my boyfriend came out and saw it right before it disapeared.  Since there are street lights out front it was kind of hard to see, so I went out back (about 9:45pm) and kept looking up in the sky.  As I was looking at the stars, suddenly one started moving across the sky and as it was headed straight for another &ldquo;star&rdquo;, that star shifted right and let it! go by then it moved back into place. Another &ldquo;star&rdquo; that it passed started moving in the opposite direction.  There were greenish light streaks moving a little ways to the left of it.  I watched all of them until they disappeared.Then around 10:15pm I went out front again and saw yet another one moving across the sky, it did a zigzag then went straight.Each one of these things were visible for under 5 minutes each before they disappeared.It is now 12:22 am and I have gone out several times since then and have not seen them again.  I will keep looking and if I see them any more tonight I will post again.If anyone else reads this and sees the same thing please post it.  Thank you.((NUFORC Note:  Probably a star or planet?

        "description":["5 or 6 objects appeared low in the sky as fireballs/dome shaped objectsI had a sighting last night (Saturday, July 10, 2010) in North Attleboro, MA at approx. 10:10 PM E.S.T..  This was also witnessed by my wife and our two sons, and also my friend and his wife (and perhaps his two kids).  We first saw the objects while driving home in our cars from a fireworks event in town.  We were in two separate cars but close to each other.  We were about 1.5 miles away from where the fireworks were when we saw about 5-6 objects low in the sky.  We first saw the objects travelling down Landry Avenue, toward Kelly Boulevard (in North Attleboro), in the vicinity of the Joseph Martin Elementary school.  They appeared to be travelling north to south (or slightly northwest to southeast).  My wife first saw them, as I was driving the car.  I looked over and my initial thought was that whatever they were, it was definitely strange (particularly the brightness and the slow movement of them).  I thought it was a constellation for a split second, but then quickly realized they were too low and too bright to be a constellation.  Again, they were very low in the sky and much brighter than any night star or planet that I&rsquo;ve ever seen.(I should mention that we had a weather cold front move through earlier in the late afternoon that day with heavy rain, so there was still a heavy overcast, although the town fireworks went off as planned.  The cloud ceiling was high enough that the fireworks were visible; no issues there.  There was no rain at the time of this sighting).We proceeded to drive to my house, which was just around the corner.  My friend and his wife were heading to their house, which was some 30 minutes drive away (Northborough, MA).  As I got out of my car, 3 of the objects were almost directly overhead.  My guess is that they were several hundred feet up in the sky, to maybe a thousand feet.  They were all uniformly reddish/orangish and appeared to &quot;shimmer&quot; slightly.  They had the shape of a small dome, and they were fairly large (you didn&rsquo;t have to strain to see them).  They were definitely larger than anything in the sky and symmetrical as best I could tell.  My wife and my two boys witnessed the same thing.  I called my friend on his cell phone and asked if he saw them, and he said he had, and thought they looked really strange.  He was puzzled too.  2 of the 3 objects were very close to each other at one point, with the 3rd one straggling behind.  At one point, the 3rd one seemed to increase its velocity slightly, moving sideways, toward where the other two were.   What I thought was really unique is that they made absolutely no sound.  They kind of hovered, then moved slightly.  I watched them for only about a minute, and then they disappeared into the overcast above.I called the local police and they said they didn&rsquo;t receive any calls; same for the local newspaper, nothing.  North Attleboro is a town of about 30,000 or so, so we&rsquo;re not a rural area; others should also have seen this (particularly with fireworks having just ended and a lot of cars on the road).  Landry Avenue is a main route that took people away from the fireworks, which many people viewed at the High School, also on Landry Avenue.I also sent an email to several friends that are in my section of town to ask them if they saw anything; I haven&rsquo;t received responses back yet, as of this morning."],

My son said it looked like  a glare on something behind the light.  But then that shape went away, and all we saw was a red fireball.  By this point, it looked like a plane on fire.  My older son called for my sister to come outside.   We stood in shock.. it looked like a plane in flight that was in flames.  We were scared because we thought it was a plane on fire and we were just waiting for it to fall... and my mind was thinking, &quot;How can a plane st! ill fly if it&apos;s on fire?&quot;... but it continued on in the distance until it could no longer be seen.  Once it was gone, we realized that it could not have been a plane because there was no noise, but it was moving in the direction that we had seen planes coming from earlier.  There were NO OTHER reports of this to the local news station when my sister called, and no one else I know saw it.  People keep saying it was a weather balloon or hot air balloon that we must have seen.  Yeah right.  I&apos;ve seen both, and this was neither."],

The plane, even though still low from departing off from Newark, flew much higher than this UFO.

We were skywatching and we were pointing out satellites to the other couple and our grown son.I pointed to one in the western sky headed due north and at approximately 40 degrees above the horizon and had them watch it.  It was approximately the same size and brightness of the surrounding stars. My husband flashed his Ryobi flashlight twice at the &quot;satellite&quot; and it stopped  WNW of us.  It lit up about as bright as 20 or 30 stars. He again flashed his Ryobi at this light and again it flashed as brightly as the first time.  The flashes were approximately 15 seconds apart.While the others watched to see if it would move I came in and got the phone to call this in to NUFORC.  I took the phone out with me and the object was still stationary.  The position of the light was roughly 10 degrees south and west of  Phecda.  I could see it until 11:02pm EST when it dimmed out and was no longer visible.  We did not see it continue north.The visiting couple were scared enough to leave, which they did while I was still on the hotline.((NUFORC Note:  We spoke via telephone with this witness, and we found her to be exceptionally rational and capable.

What shocked us most was that it made no noise whatsoever. The size was hard to judge but if it was around the size of a commercial jet, I would judge its altitude to be around 3-4 thousand feet.

The planet Venus was at an angle of 35 degrees in the horizon due West and the object was about 25 degrees angle from the horizon slightly to the north of Venus.

The glow looked like a thin ring on the outside with a solid glowing circle at the inside bottom of the ring.  The object hovered or moved very slowly northwesterly for about 7-8 seconds.  Then it rapidly accelerated and in a perfectly straight line toward the Northwest disappeared past the horizon in about 2 seconds looking more like a small star as it disappeared.   I see planes fly over all the time from Palm Beach International Airport and this object was moving about 50-100 times faster when it disappeared.

The entire crowd witnessed 3 mysterious red lights in the sky.   Prior to the fireworks beginning the lights were in a horizontal row evenly spaced apart.  As we all watched, these 3 lights moved at a very fast speed upward.  They got about a mile up in the sky (which took seconds) the first red light took off into the sky in the blink of an eye and disappeared.  The remaining 2 red lights just hovered there for about 10 minutes or so.  Meanwhile we saw 2 or 3 much smaller red, white, and blue flashing lights come across the sky.  It appeared they were trying to find out what was up there but they also just took off, not up into the sky but, to the left in seconds they were gone. After the red, white, and blue aircraft left, the red lights took off, and disappeared into thin air.  The fireworks display began and all of a sudden the 2 red lights appeared again to the right of the display.  Again they just hovered there in perfect distance apart horizontally as if they were watching the fireworks.  I tried the whole time to get this on video with my phone though the lights could not be picked up on my camera.  I do have the video of me trying, and what everyone was saying.  When the fireworks were over, the lights took off and disappeared.  This really freaked everyone out, and we would like to know what it was.  They were way too high in the sky and way too fast to be any kind of aircraft we have.  These red lights had to have been 3 or even 4 times the size of the smaller red, white and blue flashing lights."],

Appox. 20 mins after the start of the show we headed back to the car as to NOT end up stuck in traffic.  There was an enormous crowd, so the amount of people who actually witnessed this is undeterminable.  After reaching the other side of the parking lot, I looked up in the sky and noticed two red lights hovering.The lights hung in the sky silently.  They would pulsate with one another in a way that almost made you think they would have to be connected.  Because when they pulsed they also moved.  They moved in a way though that I can only describe to you as the way to opposite ends of a compass would move.  In this bending flux.After about  10-15 mins of watching these lights, they changed position once again very smoothly hovering and gliding.  It was almost like they had no gravity to govern the movement.  As when they started they were parralell to one another the light on the left then came down below the light on the right and once again they hung there just like like for what  had to be 20 more mins.  After a while they changed position again back to being paralell with one another.Then the fireworks show ended and what couldn&rsquo;t have been more than a min after they began to change color and in an instant they were bright little yellow orbs but it wasn&rsquo;t so much that they got dim or changed color but more like they got father away from us very quickly.

After examining the general area nothing seemed out of place but the area was heavy brush and near a creek.  The evidence collected has been over the last three nights.  The first night of recording about 15 minutes of audio was gathered and what sounds like morse code was captured.  The second night luminescent spheres are captured.  The third night a very bright sphere can be seen following my laser and then shoots off very fast leaving what looks like a light trail.

They proceeded to move SW from that position very slowly in a somewhat erratic pattern (not like a helicopter or plane).  They moved from the horizon to near their original position from earlier. The 2 lights hovered in the same position for another 5-10 minutes.  They would move closer together or apart from time to time.

        "description":["Strange light in Palm Beach CountyI was sitting on my patio having a cigarette when I noticed the brightest star I had ever seen.  The star was a bit strange because it didn&rsquo;t seem to be moving, but every time I would look up it would be within a different proximity of a star which was to it&rsquo;s left.  My co-worker was spending the night, so I called her out because I couldn&rsquo;t believe what I was seeing and I needed witness.  I also called my grandmother.  They both looked at it and told me that it was a typical star, just bright.  My co-worker and I drove across the street to rent a movie.  We were only gone for about 5 to 10 min max.  I went back on the porch and the bright light was now much lower to the ground, but it was still in the west.  I immediately called my grandmother because this was the craziest thing that I&rsquo;ve ever seen.  My grandmother went outside and said that it was unusual how low that star had gone.  She agreed that it couldn&rsquo;t be a star or a plane because it had been stationary for extended periods of time.  My co- worker agreed that this was strange. A few minutes after I called my grandmother to tell her that the light had moved, she called me to tell me that the light had completely disappeared.  I am wondering if there are any other reports on this same event."],

The red lights closely resembled cell phone tower lights but were far to high and far to be cell phone tower lights.  After about ten minutes the middle light started flickering faster and faster until it fell a short distance then disappeared. I continued watching and after about 5 minutes after the middle light vanished the upper most light began flashing and fell.  The upper most light continued to fall until it reached the bottom light once it arrived directly across form the bottom light the both fell rapidly until they went behind the tree line.Starting at midnight millville pa. put on a fireworks show which was located in the opposite direction of the lights seen.Approximately one third of the way through the fireworks show (20 minutes) my girlfriend and I started walking to the car, back in the direction of the stop light where they were originally seen.  I looked to my right and i seen two red lights in the sky much bigger and closer then the first time.  The red lights were moving away from the fireworks going towards their original spot.  The lights were moving horizontally and in a strange fashion.  The one in front would move a bit then stop as the one behind would move the same amount before stopping and the front one move again.The movement was much like that of an inch worm.  Once the lights arrived back at the place where i first seen them they stopped and just hovered untill they gradually faded away.I believe that they were nor still but moving in the direction away from earth causing the illusion of stillness and them fading out of sight.There was a family of 3 and two crossing guards which i know saw the lights along with me and my girlfriend."],

It looked like flashes of light in the clouds, blinking extremely fast like a strobe for a few seconds then stopping, at 3-4 minute intervals between flashes.  They seemed to be behind the thick layer of clouds that covered most of the sky.  I noticed that the television screens in my house seemed to become fuzzier during the rapid flashes.

In the sky!&quot;   I looked up and almost drove off the road as i gazed at the two orange glowing balls of flames folating up and down in the sky.  They looked four times as big as a normal sized star at night time. (There were no stars out at this time.)  She says, &quot;Could they be hot air ballons?&quot;  First off i thought...  Its 11:00PM, what kinda ballons would be out this late.  We drove DIRECTLY under them.   My girlfriend stuck her head out the window and could still see them.  If they were hot air ballons, the basket would have covered up the flame.  Also, we saw no sign of a balloon above the flame.  I took a hard left turn into the Hilliard Darby High School parking lot so i could get out of my truck.  My girlfriend started praying as i stared the objects in the sky.  Looking into the sky, if you put your fist in between the two balls, thats how far apart they were. I took a 15 second video of it on my phone.  I could see the Orbs on my phone as i recorded, but when i went to watch it the next day, all i saw was a 15 second clip of the black sky.  After i took the video, i called my dad to give the UFO sighting number.  When he did, i called and left a message on the answering mechine."],

It was red-orange and looked like a small planet or fireball at first.  When it flew over head, it appeared to be oblong, larger than a small airplane and flying about the same altitude of a small airplane cruising low to land.  The glow of the object made it impossible to identify, almost like an entire plane was engulfed in fire, but holding a consistent altitude.  It&rsquo;s sound was low, unlike an airplane and resembled a  pulse.   After it was out of view, I ran back into the house and called 911 to see if there were any other reports.  The operator checked with the sheriff&rsquo;s office and said there was no boat distress flares reported.  I guess, when I described it flying, the operator decided it was a flare since I didn&rsquo;t describe the size or just thought I was out of my mind  and  didn&rsquo;t want to be part of an U.F.O. report."],

Heading west towards the bay. By the time I got my camera out it was in front of the sun. it was climbing in altitude and slowly turning north.  It was moving about as fast as a blimp but it was as big as two and a half commercial jets end to end.  Or from my eye view about 2&quot; long. it seem to be about 12000 feet up.Report #2 Last Friday, July 9th at around 1pm, I witnessed an aircraft hovering in the sky for a few minutes while speaking with Evva.  I thought it was hovering at a height much higher than consistent with commercial airliners landing or having just taken to the sky.I was standing at 1390 Grand View Drive in Berkeley and it seemed like the aircraft was directly above us.  The color of the aircraft was dark brown or black and shaped like a perfect cylinder, with neither any tapering at either end or anything resembling the wings of an airplane.  The end of the aircraft looked like the color chrome, but that may have been the sunlight glinting off of it.  Based on the altitude I estimate the aircraft was hovering at, it seemed like it&apos;s size was much larger than a commercial aircraft.After a few minutes, the aircraft reoriented itself from an original position consistent with the hull of an airplane flying horizontally to one flying vertically, while still holding almost the exact same position in the sky.  I then departed and did not see the aircraft any further."],

        "description":["Noticed images on enlarged digital photos only after returning from vacation.Description of event:  I was on vacation in Washington State.  I was out in my pickup that I keep at my sister&rsquo;s house, doing some fishing and taking pictures of the scenery.  It was a clear blue sky and I was east of Skykomish at the Martin Creek trailhead for the Iron Goat Trail.  I thought I would head further up the road past the trailhead parking area on US Forest Service road 6710 for some pictures.  (There were two cars in the dirt parking lot).  Further on, I pasted a parked white full size van with a family that had been apparently hiking. I came to a side road that headed up the mountain on my right. I decided to take that road up to get some pictures of the scenery.  I then decided I would drive up as far as I could go where I could turn around safely. I found that spot and turned around and stopped to get my pictures.  From this spot I took 11 pictures, a few east up the valley and a few back down the road I had just come up.  I finally got back in my truck and headed back down the hill.  It was not until after my vacation when I returned back to California that I reviewed the pictures after they were enlarged on my computer at work.  I noticed on three pictures a spot that I thought must have been on the lens. All the other pictures had nothing on them. One was taken up the valley to the east and one to the west. Another at Mount Rainier National Park.  I became very interested when I enlarged these photos and wanted someone to take a look at them.I am sending a third photo that was taken on Thursday July 15, 2010 at 11:53 a.m. (exact) at Mount Rainier National Park from the east side of the mountain on the road up to Sunrise.In both cases, I heard and saw nothing at the time I took the photos.

As the clouds went by it never moved.  I was so excited that when I focused on it it was a saucer with a round light lite underneath it that was round. It just sat there at first thinking it may be a bright star.  Not even knowing if at my home at 6000 feet up if it was possible to see a star in the day time.  But with the binoculars even though only 10 time magnification I still wanted to make sure I was just not seeing what I thought I was seeing.  So I layed on the ground found the saucer again I layed there on the dirt driveway for over 3 hours.  To the point my elbows even though on the ground were getting pretty sore.I would look away then go right back and there it was.  Then the clouds getting ready to rain and being very dark.  I thought great now I will lose it.  I keeped watching and it was there under the clouds at this point all thoughts of a star or some form of goverment craft went away.  It was so windy out that if it had been anything I believe we have it would have been blowing around up there.  It never moved.  The light stayed on even in the bright daylight.  I have to say I believe it was watching me watching it.  Just a feeling I was getting.  This was no big giant craft not a triangle no flashing lights the one light just stayed fixed on.  It was the size of a truck maybe a little bigger but not much.  It was awesome .((NUFORC Note:  Venus??  PD))"],

My 20-year-old son and his girlfriend we taking a walk and enjoying the crystal clear night skies.  Suddenly my son looked to the southeast and to his surprise, there low in the sky, he observed a formation of seven bright orange lights.  The group moved like independent ships, not attached to any superstructure.  The formation was moving to northwest, when suddenly two of the ships in the middle of the group started to orbit each other.  The formation continued on a northwestern course and then they all faded away and were no longer visible.  The entire sighting lasted around :45 seconds.  The lights were the size of a pea held at arms length.  The light emitted was steady and a hunter orange color.  The formation moved at a slow steady speed.  No noise of any kind was heard and there was no flame or contrail observed.  The distance and size of the crafts could not be determined.

The time was approximately 10:30 PM and I was traveling west on Whitlock just before Kennesaw Mountain Battlefield Park, when I noticed a large, black rectangular object hovering just above the tree line.  It had one red light on the corner and two white lights on the other corners.  I had the window down and I didn&rsquo;t hear any noise.  As I reached the park, I could see that it was actually hovering at the tree line on the edge of the park.  What had initially caught my attention was that it was not moving at all.  I turned around after I passed the park to get another look, but the object was gone.  We are near Lockheed, so I thought perhaps it was an experimental craft of some sort, if they perhaps have some kind of silent craft capable of hovering in one spot.

I can see planes around that time of night and when they have their headlights on they appear as only one light instead of two.  These were unusual in that I have never seen 4 lights (planes) that close together.  One was ahead and then two, one above the other, and then the fourth appeared to be behind the other 3.  They seemed to be moving fairly rapidly toward the airport and I figured that three of them would have to circle to await their turn to land.As I watched, the lights appeared to stop moving toward the west so I thought they had probably turned enough toward my viewpoint that their forward progress wouldn&rsquo;t be visible to me.  Then, suddenly they all four went out.  I watched for awhile longer to see if those four planes landed and I saw at least one other plane go into the landing route and then a second but they were coming from the south and were not anywhere near where I had seen those other four lights.I thought it strange that those four planes had not landed and I didn&rsquo;t see any other lights to indicate where they had gone and since my husband was asleep, I figured I&rsquo;d tell him the next day.

At approximately 22:50, while in the car, I saw 3 glowing white orbs hovering just above the treeline very close to the freeway.The size of each orb was fairly large, I&apos;d estimate them at between 10 and 20 feet in diameter.  The three orbs all seemed to be similar in size.  They made no noise I could hear from the freeway. Each one glowed with pure white light.Within the span of seconds, the three orbs came streaking from seemingly out of nowhere across the sky, towards us from the north, then came to a complete stop, hovered momentarily just above the treeline, then dashed away very quickly towards the south.As soon as the orbs had sped away from us, my roommate, who was driving said, &quot;Wow, did you see that too?&quot;   We then had a conversation confirming that each of us had seen the event.I decided to submit this report after reading a local news article regarding the same event.  A unique thing about this sighting is that after getting home, I noted the sighting on twitter.com.  That record can be found here: http://twitter.com/josh_bomb/status/18097666402"],

        "description":["Saw four orange stationary lights in Southern sky about 15 degrees in elevationI walked outside to get something out of my car (time 10:50 pm PST) and saw 4 orange lights in the Southern sky.  I could see them from my front walkway but not from where I was when I got near my car as my neighbor&rsquo;s homes were in the way.  They were slightly to the East of due South.  I&rsquo;d say they were at 15 degrees as far as elevation goes.  Since there were 4 of them and the color was different than the aircraft I see flying into PDX I decided to look at them a little closer. I held still, trying to discern any movement amongst any of the lights using the roof lines of my neighbor&rsquo;s home as a reference.  I detected no movement and it crossed my mind that they could be stars.  Then I thought about it and looked for other stars in the sky and they were nowhere near the brightness or the color.  As far as brightness goes I would say maybe 10 times as bright as a normal star, and maybe half as bright as the lights I see on the commercial aircraft flying in and out of PDX.  Also they were smaller than the lights of the commercial aircraft appear.  So, I go to my car, which was closer to my neighbor&rsquo;s and just make a note of it in my head in case I hear an explanation on the news.Coming out of my car, I heard/saw my neighbor&rsquo;s garage door opening.  I was excited so I went to go tell him what I had seen.  But before I could I thought I&rsquo;d better go back to were I could see them just to verify they were still there; they were gone.  I decided to tell him anyway because he saw me and asked &lsquo;why are you running&rsquo;?  I then explained what I had just seen. About 30 seconds later tow teen girls came walking down the sidewalk (east bound).  I asked them had they seen the lights and they said yes.  I asked them if they were freaked out and they said yes.  I told them my story and that I didn&rsquo;t see what happened to them.  They said the 4 lights moved together into one.  I forget what they said about where they went.I talked to my neighbor a bit about it and then came in and called 911.  They had not heard of anyone else calling in but they gave me the UFO hotline number.  I called a 206 area code number and the gentlemen asked if he could call back in about 5 minutes.  I said yep and asked him if he was busy with the same thing I just saw.  He said yes.  I then called KGW Portland TV news, and asked if they had any reports yet.  They said no but they would contact dispatch to se if anything had been reported.  A few minutes later a gentleman from the National UFO Reporting Center called and said someone else had just called him also and they were filling out a report.  He then asked if I had internet access and I said I was right next to my PC.   He asked if I&rsquo;d fill out a report and that&rsquo;s what I&rsquo;m doing now.((NUFORC Note:  Please see two other reports from Washington State for the same time.  PD))"],

It was shaped like a compressed pill.  A cylinder with a dome on the top and bottom.  In the place where the dome forms from the straight side of the object, there was a line that goes straight across the object to the other side. This applied to the lower half of the object as well.After 45 sec or so of staring at the object, I decide to look away to see if it was an illusion in my eyes.

We drove right under it, and then I turned around to look at the red light, and it was no longer there.  As if it just dissapeared. Nothing fell from the sky or anything, we drove right underneath it.  It would have hit our truck. There was no one around.  No other cars, nothing.

Small pinpoints of bright light.The 4th flash of light was a little different than the previous ones in that it was almost like a diffused strobe flash, like when someone takes a flash picture outside at night- that kind of effect.My first thought was that it was some kind of occillating space junk or debris, and was catching the sun at a particular angle.  I thought that, because it was about the same height as a satellite.  I had seen a couple of regular looking satellites later in the evening, as well.The strangest thing about this observation, was that I saw the same kind of flashes the very next night!

        "description":["When space ships decend out of the stars and come down to earth very slowly, hardly anyone notices.July 7th 2010, 10:00pm  Walking down a street in western Seattle, I looked to the sky and saw a large bright gold object crossing the sky from east to west.  I watched it because it was unusually large and near to the earth.  The object suddenly began to fade away at a rapid speed and then turned red and disappeared altogether. Later that night, I saw four or five other bright objects zoom through the sky at an insane amount of speed.  Some of the objects would disappear and then reappear and others would turn from gold to gray.  At about 3:00am on the 8th of July I saw a brilliant light that appeared to be a golden magnetic energy rise from the earth until about two hundred feet off the ground at which point it stopped emitting the gold light and began to blink in a manner very similar to a commercial jet.  The object then blinked a pattern of red, green and blue lights, turned in my direction and then flew over my head.  I was unable to discern its shape.  It then flew away and as the distance between it and me increased, the blinking lights made the object look like a shimmering star.  But if you scrutinized it closely, you could tell it wasn&rsquo;t a star, but some form of advanced technological cloaking device.  Then I noticed there were other &ldquo;stars&rdquo; in the sky that blinked in a similar fashion.  As I watched these objects, some of them moved slowly through the sky, while others zoomed at very high speeds.  Then they objects would settle down again and mimic the stars.July 8th 2010, Dusk.Due to the prior night&rsquo;s events, I found a good viewing spot (the top of a hill in Wedgewood) and began watching the sky much earlier. From this vantage point I witnessed hundreds of these &quot;stars&quot; crept across the firmament and descended ever so slowly from the real stars to earth.  They moved so slowly that if I hadn&rsquo;t been anticipating the event and patiently watching, I never would have noticed. But I did notice.  And as the ships reached Earth the sun went down.  But just before it was totally dark, I caught a brief glimpse of one of these ships.  To my surprise it resembled a very sophisticated space-plane. It hummed soothingly.  The other ships then came in my direction traveling slow and low, but keeping their lights in a fashion as to mimic commercial jets.  Occasionally the light pattern would change into a sudden brilliant display of undulating red, green, blue and gold lights.  The ships then circled around Seattle for an hour or so, at which point some of them scattered! out in all directions, while others settled in the sky and mimicked the stars.  I stayed up all night watching the ships that remained.  Some had three lights and appeared to be triangular; others had four lights and appeared to be square. I got some footage with my cell phone.  But the quality is pretty low.  Also, they knew when I was about to take a picture because almost every time I raised my camera, they would change from what they were doing with the lights back to a commercial jet pattern.  I talked out loud and it was as if they could hear me.  For a while nothing particularly obviously out of this world happened. So I said, &quot;Okay, I&rsquo;ll but my camera away.&quot;  Then the ship nearest me did a good deal of rapid blinking and all of a sudden, to the south, I saw a golden light arise over Capitol Hill.  It neared me. When it flew past, I saw that it was another ship that had just come in.  Then I walked home and went to bed."],

We live in the Chicago Midway airport area so at first it seemed like an airplane that was on fire.  Suddenly it stopped, it went backwards, then side to side and was hovering for a few minutes, to the point where a plane flew approximately 100 feet below it.  We could hear the plane as it flew by but there was no sound coming out of the fireball looking object, even as it disappeared into the clouds.  When I saw it go backwards I ran inside my house to get the camcorder, while my family stayed outside watching it.  As soon as my husband tried recording, it disappeared into the clouds.  The entire experience was about five minutes long. Soon after it disappeared we heard helicopters near Cicero Avenue and the expressway I-55."],

        "description":["3 crafts with amber lights suddenly appear , then disappearTime: between 8 and 9 PM, near dusk, partly cloudy with haze.While working at my computer in a bedroom with its window facing south (also faces the front yard of my house), I heard some strange noises outside the window.  The strange noises sounded as if there were hard droplets, hail, or a large amount of pecans falling onto my roof and sidewalk from trees outside.  Being concerned that a thunderstorm was blowing in, I stood up from the computer and went to the window to look through the blinds to see outside.When I peeked through the blinds, the strange sounds immediately stopped.  I looked into the yard and into the street across the way to see if rain drops or hail were falling.  Not seeing any drops of rain or hail, I then looked out onto the horizon to see if there were any thunderstorm clouds, and immediately saw a series of strange lights directly south approximately 15 degrees on the horizon.At first, the lights appeared to be three landing lights on the front of a large airplane heading north. What was strange about this apparent airplane was that it was banked downward as if it were about to turn to the west, but it did not move from this position.  The lights were all of the same amber color, with the two outermost lights the brightest, the center light more dim.  The craft stayed stationary as if it were parked in the sky at an angle.  The other odd thing about this craft was that it seemed to be extremely large, and located approximately 5 or 6 miles southward near the junction of the Dallas North Tollway and I-35.  An estimate of the size was approximately 300 or 400 feet across (huge).Then, incredibly, another craft of similar proportions (but further in the distance), suddenly appeared to the left of the first craft, and it was banked at a different angle compared to the first craft.  The sudden appearance of the second craft was immediate, as if a light switch or strobe had been turned on.  My immediate thought was that there was some sort of fireworks or laser light show being given near the American Airlines Center near downtown.  Then, incredibly, a third craft, immediately appeared to the right, with the same proportions, but at a different distance than the other two craft.  The third craft was also banked at a different angle compared to the others.  It was difficult to discern whether the crafts were actually moving very slowly, or if they were completely stationary.Then, each craft blinked its lights off and on (the three lights of a craft in unison) as if the crafts were communicating with each other.  The blinking seemed to be in a sequence, as if each craft was a separate ornament on a Christmas tree.  The sequential blinking lasted less than 1 or 2 seconds.  All of the lights disappeared as suddenly as they had appeared, but not at the same time (each craft &quot;turned-off&quot; at different times).All of the above took place on the order of about 10 seconds.  I have never seen anything like it before. I have been searching the news sites to see if anyone else saw the same lights.((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.  PD))"],

        "description":["Gliding white light over Leelanau State ParkI was in Northport, MI @ Leelanau State Park.  I was camping with my girlfriend and another couple that were friends of mine. In the early hours of July 7th, just after midnight, my girlfriend and I had decided to take a walk to the lakeshore area to have a view of the stars.  We had left my friend at the campfire alone, his wife had recently retired for the night in their tent.  It had been fairly cloudy the previous night and this particular night was much clearer, so I wanted to get a good view of the stars before we were to leave the campgrounds the following afternoon.  We walked to the shoreline area and sat at a bench that overlooked Lake Michigan from a distance.  The bench looking north, over the rocks and weeds that led to the vast waters of the lake.  The sky was fairly clear and it was still night. I remember commenting to my girlfriend on how beautiful the stars were.  My girlfriend was looking for the Pleides constellation but couldn&apos;t remember exactly! what it looked like or where to find it.  As we sat there, I noticed that some clouds were moving in from the northwest and we wouldn&apos;t have much time left with the clear sky.  The clouds seemed to be moving in, fairly quickly.  I turned my head to look at the southern sky and saw a satellite moving across the atmosphere and I pointed this out to her.  I jokingly told her that for all we knew it could be a spaceship disguised as a satellite.  She didn&apos;t seem to want to go along with this joke and she repeatedly told me that it was a satellite.  I told her I was just kidding and told her it was a satellite.  At this time, I began turning my head to look back towards the lake.  My eyes quickly caught sight of a very bright white light coming in from the northwest, almost as if it came out of nowhere. Instantly I stated to her, &quot;What is that?&quot;.   We observed a very brilliant and bright white light coming in from the northwest heading in a slightly southeastly direction.  This light did not pulsate or flash, in anyway.  It was a steady light that moved briskly across the night sky, almost as if it was gliding.  Also, the light or object made no sound.  During its path of flight, it&apos;s altitude did not seem to change.  It&apos;s difficult to judge how high it was in the sky, but it appeared to be flying very low.  Perhaps a 1,000 to 2,000 feet.  It steadily glided past us.  My girlfriend attempting to tell me that it was probably just a plane, but I saw no flashing lights of a plane that I&apos;m used to seeing.  I could make no shape out behind the light.  It was so solid and bright, that if did come from an object, the light completely engulfed it.  This light continued to glide past us and over the treetops of the campgrounds, directly to the south of us.  From this vantage point we could see the back end of this moving object and the light was just as bright and brilliant from the back as it was from the front.  At this point, the object slowly disappeared into the cloud or mist cover that just hung over the treetops, and out of our sight.  As it began to fade into the low cloud&#x5C;mist cover, the white light began to fade.  I&apos;m uncertain but I thought I saw some solid form to the object, catching sight of perhaps the back end of an object, but like I said I can&apos;t be sure.  I thought I caught view a small orb like object that seemed to be attached to a larger object.  Then, it was gone.  All in all, this episode lasted about 20 seconds, from the time I first saw the object &apos;til it disappeared over the treetops. Most importantly to me, though, was that there was no sound.  This object was absolutely silent.  This object flew very low, as far as plane standards go and I&apos;m still amazed that there was no sound!   I&apos;m completely baffled by the brightness and silence of this object.  I&apos;m left with something that is absolutely mysterious to me."],

They continued towards us for a bit then turned east and headed out over the ocean.   At that point we saw 2 more appear then another 2 and finally an 8th light.  They all followed the same approximate flight pattern, although at slightly different altitudes.  The leading light then all the following lights seemed to dim and dissapear at roughly the same area over the ocean , one at a time.  A friend got her video camera and recorded much of this, on the playback we could see a perfectly round &quot;orb&quot; encircling the lights that were not visible to the eye.

Entire neighborhood witnessed.We were finishing up our 4th of july celebration and my fiance and I was getting ready to go to work.  We witnessed 2 orange lights which were very bright in the sky, moving slowly and hovering over some residentials east of us.  This was right over 21st &amp; Superior.  My fiance&apos; and I than went inside to get dressed and my father yelled down the stairs to come up if I wanted to see a &quot;ufo&quot;.When I got outside, I saw 5 orange lights in a perfect horizontal line in the same area where we saw the 2 a few minutes earlier.  The 2 end lights faded out and than the 3 remaining formed a very large triangle in the sky.  Many people must have noticed because at this point, fireworks in that area completely stopped.  The triangle formation than stretched out and got longer.  The top one than faded away and the 2 remaining &quot;lights&quot; on the bottom looked as if they began shifting.  It truely looked like the circle lights were almost &quot;morphing&quot; into a crescent moon shaped light.  Than quickly faded away.My father was snapping pictures as we watched.  I have to wait for him to upload them, but if you email me I can send them to you asap.  :)"],

        "description":["Silent, orange glowing object below the clouds traveling SW to NE.We attended a back yard BBQ and fireworks display at a family members house on July 4th, 2010.  The group was sitting against the house on lawn chairs as the fireworks began.  At 9:08pm A person pointed at a light heading from the SW to the NE.  We could all plainly see in the distance. It was a steady, orange glow.  There was no noise.  It didn&apos;t have any blinking aircraft lights (we watched aircraft fly over the area most of the evening).  It was below the clouds. It was moving at a steady speed.  From what we could tell it didn&apos;t change direction and for what I could tell went with the wind.  My wife mentioned that she and some other people saw the same light earlier in the evening in the same approximate path but didn&apos;t mention it until the second sighting.  I was videotaping at the time it was sighted the second time and managed to get some video of it.  It&apos;s not great video as I had to remove a lens from the camera I was using to shoot the fireworks and struggled with the focus as it had been set to manual for the fireworks setup.  Some of the video is crisp enough to at least see the object clearly for a few moments at a time.  I&apos;m fairly certain this was probably something terrestrial but it didn&apos;t resemble fireworks, aircraft, or balloons i&apos;m familiar with so I figured i&apos;d submit this and see if anyone else saw it as well.  The observers ranged in age from 13 to late 40&apos;s.  Blue collar to white collar workers.  Most reside in Indiana.  Several are from the Chicago area."],

I had ran inside real quick to turn on the air conditioner and neighbors were setting off fireworks and an orange ball of fire came from over the trees near where the neighbors were.  My girlfriend yelled to me from outside thinking it was one of the fireworks headed for the house and when I finally got outside to see what she was yelling about, the object continued across the sky from West to East at a constant speed. At first, I thought it was a plane on fire, but it wasn&apos;t exactly a &quot;flashing light&quot; that you would typically see on an airplane, it really looked like something on fire moving across the sky.  It looked like it was about the size of a plane, but it was flying far to low.  We lost sight of the object after it went over my house, and when we walked around the house to track it, the object was gone.  It could have possibly been a missile launch, it definitely was not fireworks.  I&apos;m not sure how many people witnessed this event other than the two of us.

        "description":["Large orbs moving at a steady altitude and velocityWe witnessed a total of four occurrences of visitor activity on the 4th of July 2010 in the Lake Forest Subdivision of Huntsville Alabama.  At 8:50 PM we saw a single large reddish orange glowing orb coming from the south moving slowing northward; it was very low, maybe 250 to 300&apos; above the rooftops.  There was absolutely no sound being emitted from the illuminating sphere.  We watched it for about 5-10 minutes as it passed over our neighborhood and then got into our car and drove to the gas station at the corner of Martin and Zerdt roads.  We could see fireworks off in the distance so we sat in the car for about 15 minutes and watched.  As we drove home heading west on Martin Road, we saw a formation of 3 glowing orbs.  This time I really thought, hey these things are extraterrestrial and I want to make sure there not hot air balloons or helicopters.  So we slowed down to almost a complete stop, rolled down the windows to see if we could hear helicopter blades, but there was no sound at all.   And they were not hot air balloons.  We had traffic behind us, so we had to move on and we are not sure where they went, but assume they continued to move northward as did the first one.  We were sitting outside and then around 10 pm we saw one more solitary glowing orb, but at a higher altitude than the others and this one was either blinking, or something behind it was blinking and we watched it move northward as well, then the dog barked, we looked away and when we looked up again it had disappeared.  Then about 15 minutes later my boyfriend said, look at that satellite.  And I said, where?  Then I exclaimed, Wow, did you see that?   He said I sure did, wow!   We saw four distinct bright lights that looked like stars that were in a cluster which was kind of vibrating and then they formed into a line and just zip off into space on at a time very quickly.  It made warp speed seem slow, they just zipped up and off into space and where gone! in an instant.  Neither of us had ever witnessed anything like this before.  We believe that since the orbs were so slow moving and close to the ground there must have been a number of others who saw the same thing on that clear 4th of July night in Huntsville, Alabama.For the skeptics, I looked up sky lanterns and balloons on-line and just wanted to let you know that there was no way the first one or the second set of three that we saw were in any way sky lanterns. These illuminating things  were huge.  They moved steadily and with a purpose.  Not anything similar to a sky lantern and we were close enough to tell that they were not hot air balloons.  My boyfriend thinks they were as large as a VW bug and my estimate is a bit larger.  They did not flicker and produced an energy glow that was supernatural.  This is the first time I have ever looked at a ufo site and ever posted any such thing.  We are both of sound mind and we were not under the influence that night.  I&apos;d like to know if anyone else has seen large orbs so closely?  Thanks."],

I proceeded to capture it on video with my camera and have included the link.Shortly after it disappeared another followed behind.  Someone on Facebook told me that it was a new kind of fireworks display but I have not heard anything of the sort anywhere else.http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aWycp3JjdBw((NUFORC Note:  We have corrected the date above.  The date of the sighting was July 04, 2010.  PD))"],

It took place a Balloon Fiesta Park with 50,000+ people there for the 4th of July fireworks display which started about &frac12; hour after my sighting.  The light was not flashing, but was constant.  The size is hard to determine, but I&rsquo;m estimating the height of the light to be 10,000 ft, moving much slower than a commercial jet which I could see much further to the west.

I had been invited to my friends new home for a few drinks and some food.  There were seven people there in total.  We were sitting on the back porch enjoying the nice night.  At approx. 11:30pm I noticed two redish orange lights off in the distance to the north of our location headed in a south east direction. Im not positive on their elevation but they were as low as a small prop plane would fly.  The two lights were flying side by side at first. One of the objects seemed to speed up ahead of the other. It slowed down just in front of the other then continued in this formation till they were out of my line of sight.  I told the others to &quot;look at those lights!&quot;  My friend scott looked but blew it off as nothing.  Then as has happened to me before everyone commented on how i was seeing things.  But i know scott saw the same thing i did.  Again, at approx.  11:45 pm a second redish orange light at the same elevation and heading in the same direction as the previous two objects came into sight.  This one was moving slowly at first but seemed to gain speed as it traveled.  This one was by itself.  It traveled in a south east direction and like the other two disappeared out of my sight behind a tree line. I did not mention this object to my friends due to the fact that they refuse to believe even the things they see i guess.  I am aware that it was the fouth of july and people were using fireworks all over the country that day but this was NOT fireworks. Im reporting this because i read that there were many other reports of the same thing.  And i wanted to share my sighting as well."],

We watched as the orbs seem to be moving to the North, Northwest very slowly.  This was a different direction then the embers from the fireworks were going.  They were about a half a mile in the air and made no sound at all.  The UFO&rsquo;s stayed the same distance apart, and really had no formation that I could recognize. This cluster of Red orbs moved out of sight in 5 to 6 minutes.  Then as I watched the sky I saw one single red orb come from the east, moving to the west the same path as the cluster moved. It seemed to move at the same speed and the same height as the others had.  The light faded and just disappeared within five minutes.  In the next 15 minutes we had seen two more orbs do the same thing as the previous ones.I really have no idea what these UFOs were but I am glad to see others had seen the same thing.

I was looking east at about 9:45pm when I noticed what looked like a lantern with orange flames in it up in the sky.  It was slowly moving NNE.  Then I noticed that there were 3 &quot;lanterns&quot; in formation moving NNE at about 20 mph.  I thought they were part of some type of airplane until I noticed that I could see distant fireworks within the triangle formed by the 3 objects. My father&apos;s eyesight is not as good as mine and he did not see the objects clearly.  He did report seeing &quot;dim lights&quot; but nothing clearly.The objects were moving in the exact same direction and speed.  One object was in the lead and the other two were at the same altitude following.  All objects appeared to be like flames &ndash; orange and flickering. It appeared that the &quot;flames&quot; were encased in rectangles.  The objects were bigger than stars but much smaller than the moon.  I would estimate the objects to be 20 feet high by 15 feet wide, at about 500 feet altitude, approximately a half mile away.  The objects continued to move NNE until they were out of sight.  There was no sound coming from the objects.I am a 50-something homeowner and have an MBA.  I have never seen nor reported anything like this before.

        "description":["Unidentified Balls of light fly over Belleville after 4th of July celebration.On the night of the 4th of July I witnessed something in the sky that I could not explain.  Yes, I understand that everyone is shooting fireworks into the sky.  However, what I witnessed I do not believe were fireworks.  I was with a group of friends, some adults and some children.  We were firing off fireworks on a dead end street.  Lots of people in surrounding areas were doing the same. We had just fired off the last of the fireworks and things became quiet for a few minutes.  As I walked into the street I heard one of my friends say, &quot;Hey check out thos!&quot;  As I looked up into the sky, I was expecting to see some more fireworks exploding, only these did not appear to be fireworks.What I saw in the sky that night were small, round, what I considered to be balls of light.  They were a yellowish orange color.  At first there were only 2 that I could see so I continued to watch them.  They were moving constantly at the same speed from the south to the north. These objects were moving horizontally not vertically.  Everyone in our group became fixated on these things. Within seconds we saw more balls of light following. I really started to pay attention at this point.  I asked my friends if they had any idea what they were, although no one had any good ideas.  These things just kept coming from the south and fading off to the north.  I started to take some pictures on my phone because I had no idea what these were.  I don&rsquo;t have a video phone so all I got was still pictures. I wanted to narrow this down to somehow explain this.  These things were not making any noise that I could tell, they all stayed in the same position as they moved by, and they were not moving! fast.  From the time you first saw one it would take at least 1 to 2 minutes until you could not see it anymore.  There was no smoke or con trails behind these objects.  They did not flash or have any lights on them.  These things were round in shape but you could not see any &ldquo;hard&rdquo; lines on them.  They were on what seemed to be a straight line path going from south to north. I did not count them because of the sheer volume of these things.  There had to have been over 100 of these.  They all trailed pretty close behind one another and just kept coming, yet they were not in any pattern or formation.  I would guess that these objects were trailing across the sky over the distance of at least 5 to 10 miles.  From start to finish we watched these things for every bit of 10 minutes. I actually called my girlfriend to ask her if she could see the same thing in a neighboring town, she could not see what we did.  I talked to other friends that were just about 1 mile away from us and they ! said they saw them but thought they were hot air balloons.My friends did not seem to be concerned about this and were saying that there was probably an explanation.  I myself was not satisfied with this. When I got up the next day this was all I could think about.  I started to look on the internet for answers but got none.  I have lived next to an air force base all of my life and have seen many aircraft in the sky yet what I saw that night I cannot explain and I wish I could.  I actually thought that since this was such a huge thing going on in the sky on the 4th of July that it would be all over the news and in the news paper, yet there were no news stories.  I believed that thousands of people had to have witnessed this also, there has to be video of this somewhere, and credible people had to have seen this.What I witnessed that night I still can&rsquo;t explain and I am still looking for answers.  I do not assume that these were &quot;UFOs.&quot;  However until I can find out what they were; they are still UNIDENTIFIED!  I remember clearly what happened that night and I am willing to tell anyone, I just want some answers."],

I was visiting my cousins and we were outside shooting fireworks until about 11:30.  These particular lights caught my eye because they seemed to be much higher and traveling much faster (and more deliberately) than anything else in the sky.  I thought they were flares with the usual red color distorted by smoke traveling horizontally dues to a light wind we had.  After reading some of the other area sighting, however, I am having second thoughts.The lights resembled the video of the Phoenix lights I have seen in luminosity and color.  The traveled though the air, one following the next, at the same velocity and same altitude.  I only saw them briefly and didn&rsquo;t think much of it at the time and went back to blowing stuff up.  We shot off and watched a lot of fireworks that night but these lights definitely caught my eye due to how unusual and out of place they were.Later that night on our way back home to Bellingham I saw a single light, just like the two I saw about an hour earlier in Bothell , in the Marysville area while driving on I-5.  Identical in every way except that it was alone and appeared to be stationary.  I, again, wrote it off as a flare, even commenting to my wife how thick the firework smoke must be to distort the color so much.With the other reports I&rsquo;m starting to think what I saw may have been something else since it resembles what other witnesses report seeing around the same time frame in the same vicinity."],

It was myself, a 31 year old female and my five year old daughter, my brother and his two children ages three and five, and my parents who are both in their fifties.  We all live next door to each other  in a very rural development at the base of Green Mountain which is known locally for UFO sightings.  It was about 10:35 PM and we had just finished lighting our fireworks.  The sky was clear and we were just catching one last glimpse of the fireworks being lit by the neighbors and getting ready to round up the kids and to say goodnight.  As we were watching the eastern sky we saw a round object very similar in shape to a balloon appear and it was heading in a westerly direction.  It was mostly red with a bright orange glow on the bottom third of the circle.  At first, we actually thought that it was a helium balloon that someone had lit on fire and set free.  But, ! the object was not acting like a balloon would.  It would speed up, slow down, hover for a bit, change directions slightly and then suddenly veer off.  We watched it for about three minutes over my brother&rsquo;s house and then we noticed that coming in from the south was another one exactly like the first.  This one was moving very quickly and heading right for the first one.  When it was next to the first one they hovered silently together for about five minutes before they went straight up into the sky.  Needless to say we were very disturbed but frankly we weren&rsquo;t sure if we had seen a UFO or some strange balloon trick by Fourth of July pranksters.  It wasn&rsquo;t until last night when my brother was fooling around on the internet and found some reports of sights that we were sure of what we had seen.  I personally have not read any other accounts or seen any videos of similar sightings, but I will be looking at them once I get this report filed to see how similar other sighting ! were to ours."],

        "description":["Orange object of July 4, 2010 in Topeka, KansasOn July 4th, 2010, I witnessed a bright orange object moving west to east over Topeka, Kansas.  I observed this at approximately 9:30 pm CDT.  I live in an area where air traffic is common (near Forbes Field) where the 190th Air National Guard Refueling is located.  It is not uncommon to see Refueling aircraft fly over, as I live close to the flight path.  I know what an aircraft looks like at close range and what I saw was not an aircraft (plane or helicopter).  I first observed this object and quickly noticed it was unusual.  At first it appeared to be a meteor. I called to another family member to come see this object.  It was a bright orange and appeared to be somewhat triangular to diamond shaped.  It was hard to distinguish an exact dimension or shape because it appeared to be flying in a haze or smoke from fireworks.  Our weather that evening had been stormy/humid and there appeared to be some fog or haze in the sky.  However, the object was first vis! ible many miles away, and was clearly seen, so I am not sure why there appeared to be this &quot;haziness&quot; to the object when it was overhead.  As I stated earlier, the object was moving from due west to due east.  It flew directly overhead.  It was hard to determine its height, because I really couldn&apos;t determine its size and make a relationship guess, but it appeared to be 800-1000 feet high.  Again, because it was difficult to determine size and height, its speed is only an estimate...approximately 300-400 mph.  Again, I watch aircraft coming and going from Forbes Field (mostly shortly before landing and after take-off), and I&apos;m judging the speed of this object in relationship to those observations.  I heard no sound from the object at any time.  I observed the object for 30-40 seconds, then went to a different location and watched it continue moving east for another 15-20 seconds.  It appeared to go into a cloud bank because it disappeared quickly and somewhat unexpectedly. ! It didn&apos;t just fade away but disappeared abruptly, either int! o a cloud bank or whatever.  It did not quickly change directions...just disappeared suddenly.When I first observed it, I thought it might be a meteor.  It&apos;s speed, however, was too slow and it was relatively close to the ground.  There was no tail or anything that trailed behind.  My immediate impression was that I had seen something I couldn&apos;t explain.  I thought, because so many people were out with fireworks that evening, that I would here something about this on the local news that night or the next day.  I&apos;ve heard nothing...until out of curiousity I &quot;Googled&quot; it.  I had been thinking that all those drugs as a kid finally had taken its toll and I was seeing things..lol.  Anyway, I was somewhat releived to see that other shared the same experience.  Hopefully this description will help you.If you have any questions, please feel free to contact me and I will try to better explain my observations.  Good luck....."],

        "description":["triangular/teardrop shaped orange light with a slight flicker to it rocketing across the sky with no soundAt approximately 9:35 PM Sunday July 4th, Danbury, CT (nearest cross street Belair Drive and Kingswood) I saw what appeared to be an orange teardrop/triangular shaped flame (not a perfect triangle but more triangular than a teardrop) arching overhead.  I first noticed it at 35 degrees WNW from my location.  It continued up overhead to about 85 degrees (almost directly overhead) and gradually faded out of view as it got smaller and smaller ESE at about 10 degrees above the horizon.  It took about 25 seconds to move this distance.  I did not hear a sound coming from this object so I would say that it was above the Earth&rsquo;s atmosphere but not as high as the International Space Station (ISS) as I&rsquo;ve spotted that a few times on separate occasions and on one occasion I saw the station also pass almost directly overhead like this object.  I cannot be certain how high the object was but that is my impression.The object appeared to be a flame although it was different from a typical rocket in that although it remained relatively constant it had a slight flicker to it like the flickering of a candle only a more rapid flickering with more of a sustained luminescence.  The flame appeared to have an edge on the forward side and came to a point at a length of about twice its width.  I could not discern a physical object in front of the flame as I was looking for something in front thinking it was perhaps a missile or the space shuttle.  The light of the object was about half as bright as the ISS at its brightest when I had seen the ISS at about a year ago passing directly overhead.I saw only the one object and it&rsquo;s motion was continual and followed a straight path and it was moving at least twice as fast as the ISS (or perhaps the same speed but maybe half the distance?).  This object literally appeared to be rocketing across the sky.  It&rsquo;s size from my perspective was about 1/8th the size of a full moon as it passed overhead.  There were 4-5 other witnesses across the street about a 100 feet away from me."],

It resembled a cigar shape/zeppelin,  It made no sound and appeared to have no running lights on the underside, but looked like the top was either on fire or illuminated with an amber-orange haze that surrounded the top half.  It made no deviations in its flight path. I am an amateur astronomer spending many nights with my eye on the sky and this object does not correspond to anything I have ever encountered.

When the fireworks began, we decided to take a break and hustled so we would be able to see them.I was in the back seat of the car and looking out what I believe to be toward the northwest.  I saw a golden globe hovering in the sky, not very high but not low either, like the height of fireworks.  I asked if the fireworks were over that way.  They were not in that direction but in the opposite direction.I looked and saw it again.  I mentioned to them that I think I was seeing a UFO but since it was 4th of July, I chalked it up to possible fireworks.  I did mention it again on the way home it had left an impression.It was gold, not bright gold but pale yet had a definite brightness that seemed to be contained in some way.  I had some sense that it may have been spinning.  I felt it had some purpose and that it was doing something. It continued to be on the back of my mind throughout the evening."],

We just thought it was a cop making sure everyone was behaving and not loitering outside the store.  We decided to get up and walk down the block for whatever reason.About seven minutes later, we heard a very faint noise above us and saw the &quot;strobe&quot; light again as we were still walking towards the boardwalk.  From what I recall, the light was white-colored (it was sort of like what a helicopter beam light looks like when they&apos;re searching for someone).  The beam of light went over us and we all saw it touch the sidewalk.  After this the ufo or whatever it was started to take off slowly then reached a faster speed as it flew off into the distance.Keep in mind that all of us were completely sober when we saw this.  Also, when we looked up we couldn&apos;t really see what color the actual flying object was, but it had a green square colored light on the bottom of it.  Behind the green square of light was the weird white-ish strobe light thing that would actually reach down and hit the sidewalk.The next day, I later found out that my friends from Rockport, MA, saw the same exact thing!  It freaked me out a lot that night, but I think it was quite the experience to see something so cool in the sky late at night like that."],

The lights were stationary and stretched from the horizon to well above a 45 degree angle in the sky. There appeared to be a faint string connecting the lights, maybe 30 of them in a line that was crooked at intervals, as though they were being towed by a plane (probably moving south as they appeared stationary).  No it wasn&rsquo;t fireworks. They stayed lit and then with I circled back within several miles they were gone. I don&rsquo;t believe it was an alien UFO.  Candidly while I believe in the possibility, I don&rsquo;t believe in the probablity, but am curious if any one else saw it and know what it is. My parents were with me and they saw the same.

The object was cylindrical with bright white lights on the entire exterior of the craft and a flashing red light at the top of the object.  It continued in a northerly direction for approximately 5 seconds when it banked to a easterly direction.When the object banked you could see the object was cylindrical in shape.

My first thought was that these objects might be hot air balloons because they seemed to hover/drift like hot air balloons.  Then, I realized that didn&apos;t make sense--they moved much faster than hot air balloons.  Since they appeared to be a fair distance away, I then assumed they might be planes from Portland airport or the military base nearby.  Although, I didn&apos;t know how far away they were, they seemed to be too close together to be planes (I&apos;m guessing 1-2 miles apart).

Animated movie from prior sighting of 1997.We call this event &quot;The July Orb&quot; because we have witnessed this twice before, all in July.The event this year, 2010, was over Bothell, WA.  An orange, glowing orb silently and smoothly cruised from North to South in the same way a satellite would move, but was only as high up as a helicopter would fly. Myself, two other adults and two children also saw it.My camera was at the ready to photograph our fireworks and to pause light in the sky, and I was able to take a photograph!  The camera zoom is a 12x.  While the photo shows a tail, this is only due to the shutter being open as the orb moved.   The falling tail in the photo is due to me trying to find it to focus. Perhaps someone can figure out the size of this orb and it&apos;s speed based on these details!  Our neighbor came by and as I showed him the picture and explained what we saw he asked &quot;Do you mean like THAT!?&quot; Pointing up, there was the same thing, moving in the same direction.HISTORY Event 1: I first saw this same orb over Bothell WA, July 1997, and called Mr. Davenport to report it. I was so amazed that I created an animated version because it was hard for others to believe there was no other way to describe it other than a mystery object.  It also moved North to South, slowing and silently gliding.  However, the object was closer than the described 2010 event as I could see it pass behind trees in front of me.Event 2: July 2009, Couer D&apos;Alene Idaho, 11 or 12 pm. My husband and my sister witnessed this same orb while sitting on the dock (south and west end of the lake).  However, it raised vertically from behind a home on the same cove about 6 or 7 houses south, or the trees behind it.  It glided silently and smoothly up, then past them and over the lake and then just disappeared.  The next day they went door to door hoping others had seen this, but no one had."],

It was very high in the air, way too high to be a helicopter with a spot light on, and was definitely not a plane.  I don&apos;t know the exact direction, but it came from the inner harbor area, and went over Patterson Park.  I asked everyone to look up at the light and everyone agreed it was definitely not a helicopter due to how high it was.  It seemed to be in the height of where commercial planes fly, but it was definitely not a plane.  It was about a pen cap size, definitely bigger than a star or a planet you can see with your eyes.  It moved slowly, it didn&apos;t zig or zag, just in a slow fluid way.  Then, towards the end, it was hard to see as it was like it was shimmering out of sight.  You really had to look for it to find it towards the end, then it just disappeared.  It was a clear night with barely any clouds in the sky so it wasn&apos;t like it disappeared behind a cloud.The light, was very solid in the center, then it was like a very slight black ring, and more light, almost like a halo around the center light.

        "description":["4 fireballs streak across WIchita Ks July 4th 2010July 4, 2010 Wichita, KS. It was July 4th and my wife and I wanted to watch the fireworks. It was getting dark, but it was still light. I got the ladder out so we could get on the roof and watch the neighbors shoot off fireworks. After my wife and I got on the roof, we both saw a fireball streak across the sky, from the south heading what looked to be due north.  There where clouds also that night. It was traveling at a very high rate of speed.  The fireball was bright orangish and was directly to the west of us.We could see it as it passed in and out of the low clouds, reminded me of the flame coming off a missle. But, I didn&apos;t think it was.  A few minutes later we saw another one.  Same type direction and so forth.  The Fourth one though, came out of the south and flew directly over head at which point I could no longer see it for the clouds.I had gotten a real good view of it. It was just a fire football shaped traveling very rapidly.  Jets fly over all the time but it was going at a much faster rate.  And it seemed to be heading North by Northwest.  It didnt leave trail of any sort and it wasn&apos;t any sort of fireworks.  I am in my 40&apos;s. I honestly dont know what it could be.  I am submitting this upon the request, of the UFO REPORTING AGENCY asked that anyone who saw anything to send in your report.  All four fireballs were flying low.The one I saw directly above me was about less than a thousand feet in the air.I had been wondering what it was we saw.  But hadn&apos;t heard anything until today, about it.  Hope this information is of some help."],

        "description":["3 orange fireball crafts traveling at an enormous speed but very high, meeting up and vanishing.I was on the waterfont (Ohio River) of Louisville, Kentucky on 2010 4th of July.   A concert was going on and fireworks were to be expected later.  I happened to look up and noticed a craft that was unexplainable.  I studied harder and harder, as did my boyfriend and human aircraft was not coming up as a logical option.  It was traveling very fast but you could tell it was so high that it wasn&apos;t going from point A to B in a snap, as others describe sightings often.  It was the type of thing that when you looked away for a few seconds, and tried again to sight it, it would be much further east.  (Kentucky facing Indiana).  Eventually it got to be at such an elevation, it was hard to keep up with and make out anymore. Moments later, I noticed even further southeast, it seemed to have two other identical objects waiting for it.  As my boyfriend and I were making our way to the port-o-john&apos;s, also in their direction, we looked up and all three were gone.  He said others around us were pointing and had also noticed.  This would have been a great time to discuss it with others had it not been for the loud music.  I was so perturbed, I came home and &quot;googled&quot; it instantly and found that someone else on www.godlikeproductions.com had witnessed the same thing as well as his wife.  He remains anonymous, but I suggested that it is okay, I saw the exact same thing, and he and I both captured it with camera.  I had seven still photos, and am regretting not video taping it.  I have always been intrigued by extra-terrestrials as well as government cover up and am excited and feel betrayed at the same time.  I am so desperate to know more.  Please contact me back."],

It was positioned due east of the condo and was just coming into our field of vision to the right of the condo building on our left.  I rushed to the video camera and by the time I was able to get it on and open it disappeared.  That video is also available. At 22:15 July 4th 2010 while standing on the 8th floor balcony of the Tradewinds Condos in New Symrna Beach the orange orb again appeared.  Myself and &quot;L&quot; were observing fireworks when it was noticed moving at a high speed from 9 o&apos;clock to 12 o&apos;clock.  When the object came to 12 o&apos;clock from us, due east, it froze and remained there.  At this point I ran back into the condo to tell our other friends and to grab the video camera.  I began filming as soon as I returned to the balcony and attached is that film unmodified.  The orb was due east over the water and far higher than the fireworks that were being launched from the beach.  If I picture my body sideways looking out to the east as the hands of a clock positioned at 6 o&apos;clock, my head as 12 and my feet were 6; raising my left arm to point to the object placed it to be at the 2 of a clock. The object was oval in shape with a circular center of brightness in the distal 1/3rd of the oval.  The color that it was emitting was orange in the proximal 2/3rd and bright yellow orange in the distal 1/3rd.  The distal 1/3rd of the object was pulsating with light and at times appeared brighter yellow to white, and pulsed back and forth to yellow orange.  In order to get a close reference my friend &quot;S&quot; stood in front of me while filming approximately 1 and a half feet from the end of the camcorder.  At this point the object is viewed directly over her head and behind her toward the east over the ocean. We observed this oval orb for about 1 minute with our first sighting and for approximately 3 minutes during our second sighting.  There was only one orb spotted during each sighting. I myself am a University of Miami alumni with studies in Science and Physics. I currently work in the Medical profession as a consultant for orthopaedic devices."],

As I was thinking &quot;What is that&quot; thinking it was some kind of large display set up my mother voiced out, &quot;What is that?&quot; and her husband said &quot;A UFO&quot; sarcastically, we pulled in our driveway and I ran back to look again and the huge shape in the sky was gone.  My brother got there slightly before me and said that the lights just faded.  They had an orange color.  Then I looked around and I saw 1 more steady orange light that wasn&apos;t moving. I looked away and it was gone again.I feel like I&apos;m going crazy.  It wasn&apos;t much higher than the rooftops and the lights weren&apos;t very bright but it was still, perfectly still in the sky and definitely had a square shape between them.About 30 minutes later there was one orange light moving pretty fast through the sky, much faster than I&apos;ve ever seen a plane move.  Shortly after that there were two planes going the same route  but slower that were obviously some kind of plane or jet flying through the sky.  I think most people would assume that those planes were the four lights but they weren&apos;t.  The lights were smaller, white, and blinking on the last 2 that I saw that I could recognize as planes, everything else I saw tonight I can&apos;t explain or describe well because I haven&apos;t seen anything like it before.I&apos;m hoping that these were just some experimental US aircrafts because I am really scared now."],

At the edge of this band of light the sky turned very dark.  In the dark area there appeared an unusual &ldquo;disc&rdquo; of gold or orange-colored light.

It kept a steady straight pace.  It almost looked like a plane that was on fire, however, there were no noises (engines) and as it flew further away from us it dissipated.  It was flying west.  If I were to compare it to the moon, I would have to say it was about the same size.  There were four of us shooting off fireworks at the time.

        "description":["Satellites that flash and then disappear and ones that change direction.My husband and I live in a rural town 100 miles north of Sacramento.  We like to stargaze and took our recliners out into the pasture where we could get a good view of the entire night sky.  We had our radio.  This was at 10pm  sometime between 10 and midnight we saw three strange flashes.  There were three incidences:  two we both saw and one my husband alone saw.The first one my husband alone saw. He said what he saw was an extremely bright flash of light, right between the two bottom stars of the big dipper.  By time he said &quot;oh wow!&quot; and pointed, it had disappeared.  It wasn&apos;t streaking like a meteor. He said it just got bright and disappeared.A while later, maybe 20 minutes to a half hour later I was watching a satellite cross the sky.  I pointed it out to my husband, &quot;I see one!&quot;.  It was directly in front of us.  We both were watching it. As it crossed, it suddenly got extremely bright. So bright the light from it almost hurt my eyes the way high beams from an oncoming car would. It lasted no more than two seconds and them dimmed.  After it dimmed you could no longer see the satellite at all.  I thought maybe it had burned up in space.  There wasn&apos;t an object to track across the sky any longer.  I thought maybe because of the brightness I just couldn&apos;t see it anymore, but it was really gone!  My husband said that was what he had seen earlier.We saw a third one which wasn&apos;t nearly as bright as the first one I had witnessed.  The third one happened the same way.  Visually tracking a satellite across the sky, this one was further to our North (our right hand side, our chairs were facing West).It brightened, then disappeared completely from the sky.After hearing reports on the radio last night, July 6th, about others seeing something unusual, I was compelled to write.  We sat out briefly last night and something unusual again.At around 10:20 we saw the same thing again.  While tracking a satellite across the sky we saw it brighten significantly and then disappear.  This was not as bright as the first one I saw on July fourth.  Maybe 15 minutes later we both saw what looked like two satellites traveling North one behind the other quite close (I have NEVER seen that before).  We watched as the one behind then gradually changed direction heading East as the first one continued North.I am 52 years old. I don&apos;t drink and I have been watching satellites cross the night sky since my early twenties when a friend pointed them out to me while camping.  I know the difference between a high flying plane and a satellite.  I have watched hundreds of satellites cross the sky and I have NEVER EVER seen this kind of thing before.  I have watched them disappear behind the Earth&apos;s shadow but nothing as strange as this."],

Deffinatly freaked me out a little but i am very interested in more information about this.((NUFORC Note:  We cannot certify that this is a serious report.

Trying to explain what we had seen we assumed it had to be a hot air balloon which would explain the fire.  After watching it for about 5 minutes a second and third one appeared to the west of it i think it would be.  I would also like to add that there were about 10 other people that were there trying to figure out what they were as well.We then decided to drive to a nearby school and ended up seeing 2 more of the &quot;fireballs&quot;.   We did not however see any fireworks so we went home.  Upon driving up to our house we noticed another one in the sky appearing to be flying north.These objects were going fairly quick to be a hot air balloon but were at a steady pace and height. There is no way it could have been a meteor.  They were definitely flying and not falling.  There was no noise or visible trails left by them.Neither me or my mother believe in aliens.

        "description":["I took my son to the store about 9:00 pm on the evening of July 4th, 2010.  We left the store around 10:15 pm. My store receipt reads that we checked out at 22:10:13.It was the fourth of July and there were many fireworks in the area.  We were driving west.   As we turned south toward our neighborhood, I noticed a red and orange fireball just above the trees to the west.   It seemed to have a red center with a orange misty glow around it.  It was about the height of a street light and from our point of view, the outer glow looked like the size of a basketball.  It was difficult to tell if the &quot;glow&quot; was part of object or due to viewing it through the windshield.I traveled a block south and turned west on a street toward our neighborhood.   I turned a street earlier than I usually do to get a better look at the object.  When I came to the next intersection, 1/2 block distance, we saw the object above a house to the south.  We turned south.  I told my 11 year old son to keep an eye on it as I drove.  I traveled the length of two more blocks (still going south)  and then turned west again.  The object was now above the houses on the south side of the west bound street.  We drove two blocks to our house.  I pulled into the driveway.  My husband was in the yard with the kids.  I jumped out of the car and pointed it out to my husband.  It was south of our house in the sky at about a 45 degree angle and getting small but still too bright to be a star - and it was orange red.  We  watched it get smaller assuming it was getting further away.   It took several minutes before it disappeared.I went inside and the family continued to shoot  fireworks.  I would estimate I was in the house ten minutes when my  son came in and said &quot;Dad needs you.&quot;   When I asked why, my son said, &quot;The orange light is back&quot;.   Sure enough.  In the same spot it disappeared it appeared again  It looked like a very bright orange star.  I watched it for several minutes then came inside.  My husband reported it moved slightly to the west and then grew small and disappeared again.What drew our attention to the object was the  fourth of July fireworks in our area.   As we were driving home and nearing our neighborhood, we were watching the fireworks.   A large firework in that area lit off but this orange ball didn&apos;t move.   We expected it to explode and it didn&apos;t.   At first I thought it was a street light on fire or a fire in the trees.   Then as it floated above the houses, I wondered if it were a parachute type firework that was on fire and I was concerned about where it was going to land.When we first saw it, it was floating about the height of the street light and below the trees.  It climbed to float above a one story house.  Soon it was above the larger two story houses and when we finally saw it in the distance it seemed to be very high in the sky.We zigzagged in a south and west pattern to our home.  The object seemed to move south - southwest.  My vehicle was moving slowly at a 15 mph estimated speed.  The object moved ahead of us and I would assume it moved a quicker speed than our vehicle,  but not much given that it dissected our route."],

It was overcast, so I didn&rsquo;t notice any stars, but there was a glowing orange object.  I had to stop and stare at it as long as I could see it, which was probably 2 or 3 minutes.  It looked to me to be kind of a disc shape, with an oblong oval shape up through the middle.  It was glowing orange.  It looked like it had a red light on top momentarily.  It didn&rsquo;t have a real crisp shape.  I&rsquo;m not sure if that was because it was glowing or what.  I was facing the West and looking up at about a 30 degree angle.  I&rsquo;m not sure if that&rsquo;s right, but it wasn&rsquo;t directly overhead, but slightly down.  In relationship to the size of a full moon, I would say it was about &frac14; that size when the moon is high in the sky.  I was! n&rsquo;t sure if it was above or below the clouds.  It didn&rsquo;t move, but faded away.  I wasn&rsquo;t sure if clouds just blocked my view at that point or what.  A car drove up, so I moved to let them by.  They commented on how strange the sky looked earlier.  I agreed and told them I was looking at my first UFO.  I was thinking they thought I was crazy, but the lady stopped me the next morning and said she saw what I was looking at after I had walked on. A few minutes after my initial sighting, just up the road a bit, I looked up and saw it again!  I watched it for a bit longer this time.  It was in the same area and looked the same, except I didn&rsquo;t notice the red light on top this time.  It did move slightly back and forth and then disappeared. It didn&rsquo;t frighten me.  It captivated me!  I have looked at and admired the night sky all my life and have never seen anything like it!  I have even lived in the Mojave Desert, where there are no city lights to interfere, and other than the moon and stars, have only seen planes and the occasional satellite.  I wasn&rsquo;t thinking of UFOs or even looking for one when I saw this.  And no, I wasn&rsquo;t drinking, and there were no fireworks nearby."],

My entire family and several other people sitting around us witnessed a light brown flying object with a glowing golden ball in the center.  This thing was not an airplane or firework debris, as it slowly flew across the length of the entire sky over our heads in a curved line at the same altitude.  It flew from a west direction towards the east, but then curved northward, again at what appeared to be the same altitude throughout.  The top of this thing spun around, and one side of it was black with something that protruded from it (you could see this black side with the protruding thing spinning slowly as it flew across the sky.)  It had no smoke, no sound, and this protruding thing swung around the top of it only randomly and very slowy while the bottom of it did not spin.  The best way I could describe the protruding black thing was that it looked like a large tel! escope with a dark shiny window in the center of it.  I say it was shiny window because you could see light reflecting off of the center of it, but the rest of the telescope thing itself didn&apos;t reflect light.  The entire object was pyramid shaped, but the top of it spun around slowly while the bottom of it seemed to remain stationery.  A glowing orange ball was right in the center of the bottom of it.  There were at least twenty five other people around us who looked up with us and watched this thing as it slowly flew by.  I have never seen a ufo before, but I have never seen anything like this thing that we saw tonight.  It happened at around 9pm at Lakeville North Highschool, about an hour before the fireworks began."],

OhioI was outside as I am every night stargazing and enjoying the summer here in NE Ohio, and happen to catch a far off neighbors firework display off in the distance (Due South).  During the show (they were small fireworks) a orange orb of sorts was hovering right above the treetops off in the distance as if it was watching the display.  It was still, pulsated orange/red (I thought it was a cellular tower at first but then I realized that HEY we are out in the country, there are only trees out that way)  It moved slowly westard, sat another few moments, moved eastward, sat a few moments, faded out, reappeared slowly 2-3 minutes later, sat about 2-3 minutes, and slowing faded out of sight.  I would be shocked if the party people did not notice it, but you never know, the wiskey runs a little freely around the 4th).  I have seen this particular orb/UFO three other times over the past 2 months with the same mannerisms.  My honest opinion about this particular episode was that it was indeed watching the fireworks display.  You can almost tell it was intrigued by the display as if a small child was peeking around his fathers legs to check out a large dog.  It is so exciting to see our alien friends coming out of the woodwork, every night is a new adventure when darkness falls on NE Ohio!"],

I was in the park with my family for the city of Franklin fireworks display. As usual, there were small aircraft occasionally flying overhead and several private fireworks displays going off nearby.I pointed out to my wife a steady, orange light in the sky, slightly smaller than Venus, in the west. The object was moving at a steady rate from west to east, unblinking, without changing apparent direction. After watching it for about 5 seconds, the light &quot;winked out&quot; and very briefly returned to view, continuing its course, before &quot;winking out&quot; again. The sky was not yet fully dark, but the light source of the object was distinct and bright. The &quot;winking out&quot; seemed to be consistent with a 90-degree turn along the plane of sight, but there was no continuation of sight after the second &quot;winking&quot; episode. The light did not flash, nor were there any standard airplane colored lights (red, green, or white) associated with it. I am unable to judge the distance of the object or its actual size. In shape it appeared to be circular, perhaps because of distance.I have taken courses in astronomy and have seen many satellites and meteors over the years. This object was too bright to be a satellite; it was not yet dark enough and the ambient light should have been sufficient to block a satellite from view. The sudden &quot;winking out&quot; was inconsistent with a satellite. It moved too slowly to be a meteor."],

        "description":["2 Saucer  Dish Like objects in the sky glowing orangeMy Boyfriend, and I, were outside grilling some food on the 4th of July 2010.  It was approximately 9:25 pm or so when I sat down at the table and I was watching the neighbors down the block blowing off some fireworks in the distance.  I got up and walked to the back of the yard so I could see if I could see any other fireworks going off.  As I looked over the front of my house, I seen this object coming toward me. It was orange in appearance, and was almost like glowing, like an aura around it or something. It made no noise what so ever.  It was almost silent, but looked almost like it was spinning the body part of it, but was just moving forward.  It was the strangest thing!  I started freaking out, and yelled for my boyfriend.   As he came over it was now almost right over the front of our house. It wasn&rsquo;t very high in the sky maybe a couple hundred feet above our trees.  He ran into the house, and tried to grab the camera, but by the time he came back it was alre! ady over our neighbors house, and hidden by their trees.I kept watching in the sky, turning in circles hoping I would see it again.  Maybe 2  minutes later another one appeared in the same direction the first one appeared to of come from.  This one was way up high still in the sky coming down from the clouds.  It seemed to stay up in the clouds as it moved along heading toward my direction kind of diagonal though along my fence line.  An airplane was coming in the sky toward it I believe it was maybe like 9:28-9:30 pm or so by now not sure. As the airplane headed toward this unidentified object it went back up in the sky, and the lights seem to disappear, or go off.  The aircraft then was over the spot where this craft was, and went passed it. I thought it was gone but then it came down out of the clouds but behind my house in the sky.  This time the craft came down and had it&rsquo;s lights out and seemed to be a bit bigger than the other one that went over my house.  I could clearly see this space craft because of the street lights behind m! y house in the court. It was clearly a flying saucer, disk shaped.  It was grey, silverfish looking,  and was flying quietly. It was moving very slowly like hovering, or scoping things out.  Then it began to speed up and looked like it was coming down.  It was flying like it was looking for a place to land, or  something . It disappeared on the other side of the block past the trees where I couldn&rsquo;t see.I didn&rsquo;t report this to Local police department. I know how people get treated, when they report these things to police departments, and say they see UFO&rsquo;s. I know what I saw, and it wasn&rsquo;t no airplane, fireworks, none of that. I got a good clear view of these objects, and I am positive about what I seen.There has to be others here in town that seen this. I don&rsquo;t know if anyone else might of reported this here in town. They didn&rsquo;t say anything about it in the local papers, but that isn&rsquo;t surprising where we live. I just want to report this, so if others have seen anything, they will know they aren&rsquo;t the only ones, and it is documented!"],

        "description":["Craft with large yellow/reddish color light observed over Great Falls MT on July 4th, 2010To whom it may concern, I am a middle aged police officer and my wife works for an investment firm.  In my career I have seen many strange things, but this observation clearly tops them all as far as being unexplained.   On July 4, 2010, at approximately 2145 to 2155 hours, I was sitting near the bank of the Missouri River on the 300 Block of River Drive North in Great Falls Mt.  I was sitting with my family waiting for the city fireworks display that was set to start at approximately 2200 hours.  We were sitting on the east side of the river facing westbound where the fireworks display was going to be launched.As we were waiting for the show I noticed an aircraft flying eastbound over the city (Est. elevation 10,000 feet high).  Normally this would not be note worthy because we were sitting under the flight path of airplanes landing and taking off from the Great Falls International Airport.  This particular craft caught my attention because it appeared to flying too high to have just taken off from the runway.  Normally, I have noticed flights that don&rsquo;t land at the airport fly on the outskirts of the city.  Also, I noticed an extremely large glowing yellow/reddish color light underneath the aircraft.  The light took up the whole diameter of the craft.  The light appeared to be the approximate size of a Boeing 747.  I observed no red or green tail or wing lights on the craft.  There was no apparent spotlight shining in front of the craft.  I also could not hear the craft&rsquo;s engine.  It should be noted it was extremely windy and this could have had an effect on the sound waves reachi! ng my location.  The craft also appeared to be flying slower than a jet craft would have at that altitude that was not planning on landing.At this time, I pointed the craft out to my wife.  At the same time we both said we have never seen an airplane or helicopter that looked like that.  We debated over whether a satellite would have the same characteristics.  During this time there were approximately 15 people that were sitting near us on the riverbank.  Several of them were watching the craft also.  Some of their conversations were similar in nature to ours (Unknown names of the other witnesses).I continued to watch the craft as it continued eastbound until I lost site of it as it headed east past the city.  Great Falls has Malmstrom Air Force Base, Homeland Security Base, and the Montana Air National Guard.  My job has allowed me some access to these bases on occasion.  To my knowledge, none of the aircraft they fly looks like this.  After hearing about similar related sightings of this nature on July 4th on Coast to Coast, I felt compelled to pass on my observations.  I hope this information will help, I just wish there could be an explanation for what we observed."],

Up and down than would disappear. than would re-appear 3 miles or so in the opposite direction with only 1 of 4 lights on which were eratic in sequence , red, green,orange, and the 1 bright light. than it would hover and shoot straight down at a speed no aircraft could do at an angle than stop and hold position, than the smaller colored lights would be off than the xtreme bright light would re-appear. example: think as if you were in a corner of a dark room with a flash light moving it around and turning it on and off and moving the flash light within a certain perimeter left to right up and down. Than the fireworks started, thats how! i could guage the distance of the craft, in the clouds and distance from me and what it was doing. based on the height of the fire works and the mountain range behind it. The 1 very bright light had to be at least the size of a 2 car garage, doing meneuvers and changing lights at least 1 mile above ground and not breaking the boundry of a 3 mile radius in either direction, the craft was not visible other than the strobes and the bright light. After the fireworks started, the display of activity became more pronounced and the only word i can think of is aggitated. it almost seemed like, the bright light would shut off, and almost immediately be in a totally different level and area at a triangular descent than the other lights would be on, the craft was consistant in this fashion with the lights, almost as if the lights were for identification or communication. Note: i live in a canyon and at this distance you can hear helicopters, jets over head, and re-con planes, that fl! y even higher over everyday noise, this craft was silent, not ! a blip o f nothing. I am use to seeing all sorts of aviation fly over my neighborhood, this craft wasnt made on this planet, it had xtreme responce at angles impossible for any pilot to endure and at speeds i have never seen. it was consistant, i actually got so tired of watching i just went back in the house. I told my chef buddy at work the next work day about it, than he heard about the reports on coast to coast and informed me, that is why i have come to youre site. lets hope it is not demonic ."],

        "description":["Zig zaging fireballAt about 10 pm on July 4, 2010, my 12 year old son and I were standing in our front yard shooting off fireworks. I was looking at the sky facing south when my attention was drawn to a very bright reddish light low in the sky. It was about the size of a star, but it was the brightest thing in the sky. I watched if for about 2-3 seconds, before I realized it was obviously moving directly toward my position. It was getting visibly closer and appearing larger by the second.I called my son&rsquo;s attention to it, and he also saw it. By this time it was not quite directly over our heads. I got a very good look at it. It appeared to be a round ball of reddish orange flame.  It definitely had the appearance of flames, but there was no visible smoke or sparks. It was completely silent and moving in a straight line, south to north.  I saw no visible structure of any type. There was no noticeable wind blowing at the time.It passed almost directly over our heads. I turned around so I could continue to watch it as it passed by me on its way north.  After watching it for a few seconds now from behind it, I saw it make a little series of zigzag movements, right, left, then right left, again.  It then continued heading off to the north in a straight line until it disappeared from my sight.It was impossible for me to accurately estimate the speed, size, or altitude, in the dark sky. If I was going to guess based on my gut feeling, I feel it was smaller (less than 3 ft. in diameter), rather than a large object and at a few hundred feet elevation, rather than higher. It was moving quickly relative to its size.  The total time I watched it was about 20-30 seconds, maybe slightly longer.There are a couple of things I am sure it wasn&rsquo;t. It wasn&rsquo;t a firework, like a rocket or mortar. It was totally silent, slower, and left no trail. It also did not look like any flare I have seen either. It was not smoking, sparking, leaving a trail, or appear to be dangling from a parachute."],

I also saw a C-17 flying a couple hundred feet level over the old Norton Air Force Base at the same time.  I lost sight of both aircraft (C-17 and F15&rsquo;s) due to the trees near my home.

The street we were on ran north and south. A red fireball appeared in the northern skies, directly north of us, and we initially thought that it was a flare someone had shot off.  The red fireball continued to fly overhead and to the south-south-east.  It was definitely flying lower than a commercial airliner but higher that a local police or news helicopter would be flying. Its altitude was more like what the local military jets fly.  Its flight speed was also similar to what U.S. jet would be.  Also, it did not emit any noticeable jet, propeller, or helicopter rotor sounds.  Once it was almost out of site, it appeared to increase altitude and head back northerly along the same path.  We then notice two additional red fireballs coming from the same northern location and travel along the same path as the first.  I ran into the hou! se to get my binoculars and viewed the crafts as small single balls of reddish light; no other shape of the craft was apparent in the dark night sky.  One member of our party took two digital still pictures of one of the crafts with little to no enhancement by the limited zoom.  Before the end or the half hour encounter, four more craft individually traveled overhead from the north to the south.  All craft had the same attributes.  We did not stay out any longer than that due to our lack of fireworks and the night was very cold and windy."],

They looked identical to the descriptions given in multiple reports and the video on your homepage.  We had no idea what they were.

The object seemed to be moving faster than a typically seen light aircraft in the area.  The object was seen in a southwesterly direction from the city of Mulberry, Arkansas (Western Arkansas).  The object moved north then turned and proceeded west.  There was some dusk light on the horizon.   We dismissed it as an aircraft, but the appearance simply didn&rsquo;t fit with typical marker lights of a light or even higher flying jet.  I  and my family live near an airport in Fayetteville, AR, and are airplane observers.  I have been involved in identifying aircraft and have made a hobby of learning about airplanes for over 30 years.  I am a science instructor as well.  The objects main characteristic was the orange color and was very strange as an observer looked at it head on.  The orange color did change somewhat as its direction changed.   I dismissed this sighting until I heard that many others throughout the country had seen objects on the same night.  (What we saw was not a fireworks display.)"],

The camp is located approximately half way between Coudersport, PA and Galeton, PA (not too far from Denton Hill State Park).  Sometime around 22:20, we noticed an orange fireball going slowly across the sky.  The fireball appeared to be traveling from North to (SouthEast).  The five of us were astonished.  It did not look like a plane or helicopter.  It was definitely an orange glowing ball.  My husband and friend felt for sure they saw some type of tail at the end of it.  I did not notice it.  The fireball was traveling in a fairly straight line at first.  Then it seemed to change directions (zigzag) several times, almost as though it was losing its course.  After viewing this for several minutes, the glow became less and less until we couldn&rsquo;t see it anymore.  It did not appear to have traveled out of view, but more like it burnt out.  It was not a shooting s! tar and did not look like a meteor.  Nor, was it &lsquo;The Northern Lights&rsquo;, not even close.  It also was not part of a fireworks display.  It was extremely high in the sky.  For those people who may say it was just too much July 4th celebrating, our 14 year old daughter witnessed this also."],

        "description":["Looking NE there was a bright round/triangular object hovering in the sky and moving sporadically; changed in shape, size, &amp; brightnessLast night on Sunday, July 4th, 2010, in Deer Park Ohio (just outside of Cincinnati) at around 10:00pm my mom (medical field), her boyfriend (ex-army officer) and I (student) went outside to look at fireworks.   After a few minutes, my mom&apos;s boyfriend  looked North East and pointed at a bright object in the sky.  At first he thought it was a star of some kind, but it became apparent after a few minutes that it was too large and bright to be a star.  The object appeared to be a ways in the distance, though I couldn&apos;t say the exact miles.  At first it looked rounded in shape and a bright white, though after time it would change in shape and also brightness.  The shape would change from round to almost triangular, would dim and brighten, and would also at time get smaller and the stretch out again.After the three of us arguing about what it could be (approx. 15 minutes later), I noticed more and more that it seemed to be hovering rather than still standing.  From the time we first spotted it, to around 10:20pm it had moved (in comparison) from one end of our house to the other.  After more speculating, I went inside to grab my moms&apos; phone camera and also a small pair of binoculars.  Finally, now having a better view of the hovering object, I honestly cannot tell you what it was.  I&apos;ve never seen any star, aircraft or anything of that sort like that before in my life; both my mom and her boyfriend said the same.  Using the binoculars the object appeared triangular but seemed to have a faint rounded halo around it.  It was bright with in the center but also had small blue/green &quot;lights&quot; (quotation because I don&apos;t know how else to describe them).  Every so often it looked as though there were bright red streaks that would flare out from the object almost like what you wou! ld see on a jet of some sort.  After watching it more closely we started seeing it move sporadically up and down, and to the left.  The movement wasn&apos;t big, but enough so that it was clearly noticeable.The time now was around 10:30pm, and while myself and my mom were still watching it, my mother&apos;s boyfriend got bored and went back into the house.  I really wanted to see if we could get a better view of the object, so I talked my mom into driving closer toward it.  We went down streets and back roads and were able to follow it for quite a ways.  We got a little closer to it, but in the end it was late, and we were too tired to keep driving.  I last saw the strange object at around 10:45-10:50pm when we turned around back toward home.  Once we arrived, now around 11pm, we searched the entire sky around us, (of course including where we first spotted it)  but saw no trace of the strange bright object any longer. It&apos;s as if it just disappeared.Even thinking back on it now, It was like nothing I&apos;ve ever seen before... it was so brilliant and brightly colored, even more than the tiny specks of stars around it. But the shape of it is unlike any air craft I know of. It was and still is incredibly fascinating. Though unfortunately, my moms&apos; phone camera was all we had at the time... So the few pictures we took came out unclear and did not do justice to how amazing it looked with the binoculars aid.  A few photos we did take however, show the relative size as well as it moving (you can clearly see a &quot;tail&quot; or steak behind the object.) If you want the photos I will gladly send them to you. And also, any information you may have as to what this object could&apos;ve been or even if someone around our location reported something similar, we would be most grateful. Thank you for your time.((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.  PD))"],

I went to the front yard to get some photos of the fireworks behind the house.   When I looked to my left, south east of the house, I saw an unusual light in the sky between the two hills.  I went to the back yard to show my brother the pictures I took.  He ended up deleting the photos of the object because he thought they were bad fireworks photos.  I told him about the object.  The he told me he saw it from the backyard and our mom, who overheard us talking, mentioned that she saw it from the back porch.  She thought it was a tower light until she realized there is no tower there.  By the time we looked up in the sky again, it was gone.  I guess it was there for about 5 or 10 minutes.  I&rsquo;m not really sure.  I saw it twice from the front yard and it hovered in the sky long enough for me to snap the photos and walk to the back yard. It was really just an orange-red glowing ball that did nothing but hover in the sky.  It seemed larger than a star but not as large as the moon.  Nothing weird happened, nor were there any strange feelings or happenings associated with it.  There were lots of fireworks going off all over the neighborhood.  Seems like whatever it was, was just a part of the &ldquo;show&rdquo; or enjoying the show, like the rest of us.  My mom and I are not believers in UFOs or Aliens.  My mom, brother, and I just chalked it up as a strange phenomenon.  I wasn&rsquo;t going to report it until I saw on your website that dozens of reports were made the same day.  I just think it&rsquo;s strange.  I don&rsquo;t really have any more details than that."],

        "description":["triangular formation of five orange glowing spheres on fourth of july about the time of fireworks.On fourth of july, myself, two friends, my girlfriend and her daughter went to the highest point in our city to watch the fireworks.  From this vantage point we could see about eight different shows.   When we first reached the top of the hill the fireworks had not yet begun, but as I scanned the horizon anyway I saw what looked like the orange lights of an oil drill rig out far in the ocean.  What was strange about it was that there are no oil drill rigs ever visible in my area, also it was far above the horizon which made me sure that it was airborne and was not floating in the ocean.  At this time I had pointed the object out to all the members in my group, they all confirmed this: we all saw five perfectly round spherical looking orange lights that seemed to be in a triangular position aimed in our direction( it would have been pointed northeast from the beach of orange county)we were staring westward out over the ocean.  As the show started we all noticed the lights raise up into the marine layer clouds.  During the show it seemed to poke out once but only with three lights visible. When the firework show was over, we noticed that all five lights in triangular position were once again visible and that it still seemed to be pointed in from the coast(north-east).  We stared  about 15 minutes at this until we decided walk home.  Back at home, I myself looked at the horizon since my interest was peaked, but the lights were completely gone, I noticed this at 22:30.  During the time of night we had these sightings there was a layer of clouds over the entire night sky so that the stars were not visible.  The last sighting of all five orange lights in formation was still easily seen through the mass amounts of smoke added to the cloudy sky after the firework show."],

The first object appeared from the s by sw going east by Ne. Elevation 2-3K feet up airspeed 300-400 MPH.  It was red/orange in color with some white light apparent on top. It lit the clouds up as it passed. Flew on a straight line, no sound at all.  As I first saw it made me think of a flying burning car. It had a rectangular shape as it crossed my view.  But all of them appeared to be more round then anything.I called the police and asked if anyone else was reporting what we just had seen and was told no.About 2-3 mins later the second came in a bit more east then the first.  Looked like the same craft.  I thought it had turned around- It followed the path of the first on.  IE it turned a bit to do it.  Again i called the police and was told no one else was reporting it.  They sent out a officer about 7-10 mins later.While waiting the third appeared this one much more eastward then the previous two.  It looked identical to the other two.  Again it turned and followed the other twos path.  I did whip out my blackberry and start shooting.  Got four shots one bright. the other three show it getting smaller as it went away.  Time between pictures was 5-6 seconds so it was moving rather quickly.People in surrounding suburbs described the same thing.These were not lanterns or fireworks flying by.  It was weird how you could see the clouds directly above these crafts."],

I was looking up at the sky watching the fireworks, when I observed a very subtle red/orange shaped object moving from south south west to north north east at a very high rate of speed.  Actually the red/orange colored looked like more like an aura around a dark center.  It was too fast to be a normal satellite but slower than most shooting stars.  It wasn&apos;t bright like other objects in the sky and just barely noticeable.  One would have had to be looking right at it to notice it.  It was one of those cases of just happening to be looking at the right place at the right time.  The odd thing was that at one point it appeared to slow down and then speed up again. It never changed its course though.  The trajectory was very straight.To give you some background on me, I was a police officer for eight years before being medically retired.  What I saw wasn&apos;t a normal satellite like I see in the sky all the time.

        "description":["On July 4th Looked like 1 round fireball, but was 3,,  55 PicturesI live in a small town of Fort Calhoun about 860 people (not much light at night) on the top of a hill so the stars are real bright. This is about 8 miles North of Omaha, Nebraska.On the night of the fourth of July, I was standing out at the end of my driveway taking pictures of fireworks with a Canon 40D SLR with a digital image stabilizing lens that is 70-300mm zoom.  (About $3000.00 worth of equipment). I was not using a tripod, but hand held so I could move around to catch the fireworks.The front of my house faces straight West.  The night had a broken cloud base, more open than clouds.  At approximately 9:55 pm I noticed a reddish orange light to the South, South west from where I was standing about 2 to 3 miles away coming from the Bennington Nebraska area.  It was moving very slow to slow to be a plane and heading almost straight North.  It had no blinking lights at all. It was just above the cloud base.  I had my camera set on manual mode and was running the shutter speed between 4 and 8. I took a few pictures of the light and after zooming in on it I could see that it wasn&rsquo;t one light, but three real close together.  We have had helicopters come by and at about that distance before and we could not hear a thing when normally we could.  After watching it for about 5 minutes, I went back to the house to get my wife and show it to her.  Of course she saw it also.They continued to travel North until they were just South of my location, then took a 90 degree turn to the East for a very short distance (guessing &frac12; to 1 mile) then another 90 degree turn back to the South.  Looking at the night sky it would be like the directions of the eraser end of a new pencil.  After watching them head back South about &frac12; the distance from when I first noticed them.  It was like someone threw a light switch and the lights went out.  Gone.  Way before they would have flown out of sight.About 10 to 15 minutes later I saw them again straight in front of my house, looking West.  They looked to be about 1 to 2 miles out.  There were different times that through the camera I could see that they didn&rsquo;t stay in a group, but would spread out in a line.  If it was one object I would see a leader and then a trail, with the lens settings I was using,  However you can see the trails, but with three balls in the trail.  A leader, one in the middle and one towards the end.  I took 55 pictures of them in all.  They kept heading in a Northern direction and it looked like they would have gone just North of Blair Nebraska.  Some pictures came out pretty good, some not, due to the speed of the lens or my movement.  The entire time that they were visible was about 20 to 30 minutes."],

He agreed that this was a strange red light indeed.  We live below a flight path of the airport so we often see incoming planes in the distance, but usually the planes we see have many red and white lights that are constantly flashing.  This object had one big red glowing light (perhaps a distant orb but all we could see was a bright red light).  We talked about the possibility of a satellite, but it was so red, and seemed much closer.It moved slowly across the sky.  There were occasional fireworks coming from either side of the sighting, but the object was in a clearing between the two houses launching the fireworks.  The light moved too slowly, too horizontally, and too straight to be a stray firework.After a minute or two of watching it move across the sky, I ran into the house to get my glasses.  The light was moving slow enough that I figured I would have time to get my glasses before the view of the light would be blocked by the trees.  To my surprise, the red light had stopped completely in its tracks. My husband and I continued to stare at the red light, as it seemed to hover in one spot.  It was completely still.  We discussed the possibility of a distant helicopter, but it was silent and completely unwavering.  We probably watched it for 2-3 minutes before the light got smaller and dimmer and suddenly disappeared.  It did not seem to MOVE away.  It seemed like it just faded into nothingness."],

        "description":["Formations of glowing and non-glowing spheres hovering over a Kansas city.Of course, this 4th of July involved fireworks. Note that what I am reporting as &quot;fireballs&quot;, &quot;glowing lights&quot;, or hovering spheres, are not the likes of any firework which I am familiar with.Around 9:15 p.m., a friend and I sat on my back porch watching fireworks displays from various neighborhoods around us.  We set off a few of our own, but nothing big.  Neither of us had any alcoholic beverages that day or night, nor do we do drugs; our states of mind were as sharp and relaxed as possible.When looking south, during a lull in the fireworks, we both noticed (and promptly pointed out to each other) 4 objects in the dark sky.  We were looking at about a 35 degree angle of elevation.  The objects seemed to hover in place, making only minuscule adjustments to hold formation due to strong winds.  They glowed with an orange-red light, the closest approximation of which I can make is the HTML Hex code #CC1100.  It was not an extremely strong glow, in that I could not see it illuminating any objects on the ground, trees, or even that much of the smoke present from the fireworks.  However, it was clearly bright enough (or close enough) to reach my friend and I with no problem.  They were arranged in what looked from our viewpoint to be the shape of a rhombus or diamond shape, but I cannot say for sure due to our angle and imperfect depth perception concerning their distance from one another.  They seemed to act together, as though they were all present for the same cause or of! the same force.Other similar formations could be seen from the front of my home looking northward; one directly north and one in the north-northwest.  The latter formation was at a greater distance from us, causing the glows to appear smaller and sort of blend together, creating uncertainty on the number in that formation.  We could only assume that there were also four there, as this is how the others were arranged.The formation to the south was still closest to us, and we mainly observed it.  It remained still, emitting no beams or objects, but the objects seemed to alternate positions every 45 min. or so.  About 5 min. after a rotation, the object closest to us (on a the point of the rhombus) darted towards us significantly. It hovered now above the pond directly behind my house.  It faded in color and luminescence as it neared, becoming completely matte black by the time it reached us.  It hovered there, and had it not been for fireworks on the horizon and city lights illuminating the haze, it would have blended easily into the night sky.  We had a Nikon D5000 with an external flash and telephoto lens, and immediately started fumbling for it to try to capture it on camera.  The camera would not boot up.It usually takes about half a second to turn on and become ready to shoot, if that.  But it wouldn&apos;t. The battery was charged, for we tried two of them, both of which had been charged that day.  It was in the right way and there should have been nothing to interfere.  In the dark, I tried to use my lighter to see if there was some fault or something that could prevent it from working.  It was a push-button or electronic butane aerosol lighter, where one clicks a button down, creating a spark, and igniting a jet of butane fuel.  The fuel came out as usual when the button was depressed, but the spark would not work. Neither would my friend&apos;s.We took this to mean that after going into some sort of less detectable mode, it also activated a device that shut down certain electronic capabilities within a reasonable proximity.  Unable to capture it, we could only stand in awe.  It looked to be about 15 ft. in diameter, and rotating a bit in one direction before reversing its spin. It spun fairly slowly, almost like it was just drifting there.  After about 3 min. of suspension, it flew back to its formation.  It did not change color, but by the time the craft got back, the formation was then the same shade of matte black.  It was unbelievable how...black it really was. It seemed to just suck in all light.  There were minor indentations around the craft, visible when not luminous, around the &quot;equator&quot;.  Just short dashes, impressed into the material. This allowed us to notice the rotation before.After reforming, the formation flew northward at unnatural speeds.  There was no time for acceleration. It was just...going.  It went from a stop to its desired speed immediately and remained steady at that speed until arriving near the northern formations.  They joined to form a loose squarish shape. This larger formation flew northward while gaining altitude at a steady pace.  I can&apos;t imagine why only the one formation would go into its &quot;undetectable&quot; or stealth mode while in the larger formation, but it remained that way during its exit.My friend has done no real research into ufology or related fields, and previously was just oblivious.  He had no opinion.  He always took a tolerant, but non-believing, attitude towards matters like this. I have read numerous books, online articles, and viewed a vast amount of serious multimedia on the subject, including photographs, video recordings, and audio clips.  I don&apos;t consider myself to be a serious researcher by any means, but I do take matters of this nature seriously."],

        "description":["&quot;Burning&quot; flying object passes at least 3 times east of North Bend, Nebraska, USAObject sighted:  Yellow-orange flying object which appeared to be &quot;burning&quot; from the quality of the light.Location:  North Bend, Nebraska, USA  Direction:  East Angle of view:  Approximately 30 degrees above the horizon.My family and I spotted a flying object flying almost exactly north, in the sky east of North Bend, Nebraska. The sighting took place on July 4th, 2010.  My wife and I were lighting fireworks in the back yard of her parents&apos; house when suddenly the people at the house started talking and pointing to the east.  They called out to me, &quot;What is that?&quot; I saw a light moving far in the distance. Initially I thought it was a helicopter because the light seemed to flicker, like the flame of a candle.  However it was high and very fast and the light seemed to be one of burning, and not an electric halogen bulb like you see on modern aircraft.  Additionally, there were no red and white strobe lights that are standard on regulation aircraft (we could clearly see these on commercial aircraft passing at cruising altitude high overhead).  It continued north (it had first been spotted to the southeast of us), and the light didn&apos;t really change as our perspective of it did as it passed (i.e., there was no dimming effect like you might get from headlights passing you as the craft eclipses its lights, etc.).It was flying quickly, at least the speed of a large helicopter or a plane. After a minute or so it was across the sky, and northeast of us, when it rather quickly faded out of sight entirely. This was surprising to us because we were seeing commercial jets far over head and could clearly make out their blinking red and white lights over an altitude of at least 15,000 feet.The object (or a second one, identical to the first) appeared again about 15 to 20 minutes later, again in the southeast.  It followed the exact same flight pattern as the previous, vanishing again in what we can say at best was the same spot as before.A third and identical sighting took place roughly an hour after the first one.  By the third time it came around, we had gone inside to get some binoculars. The object was difficult to focus on, but the characteristics of the light coming from the object was more akin to the flame of a candle than the steady shine of an electric source.  I&apos;d say it was about 10 times brighter at least than the brightest star in the sky at that point, and perhaps three times the diameter of any of the stars.  My father in law was able to track it in his binoculars, and describes that it seemed like a round object, like looking at a disc on its side or perhaps a sphere, with the burning light coming from around the perimeter of the circumference.All in all, the sightings took place between 10:00 pm and 11:00 pm, US Central time.There were 6 adults and 2 young children at that house, and we all saw it each time.  After the third one, my father-in-law and I went next door to see if the neighbor had seen the same thing.  She and her two grandsons had seen it during one of the fly-overs.  She thought at first that it was a basket from a hot air balloon, saying that the light&apos;s quality made her think of the hot air generator present in such balloons. But she quickly realized it was moving far too fast to be a balloon.The object&apos;s trajectory was more or less level across the sky, parallel to the ground for an apparent distance of several miles, except at the end it could possibly have been increasing altitude, but hard to say without any precise measurements.The following day (July 5th), we communicated with some family who live in Wichita, Kansas, and they saw the same object flying in the same direction.Though the light was the brightest thing in the sky (the moon was not visible at this time), we heard no sound from the object on any of the three passes, only the sound of fireworks across town.  Also there was not much wind that day, so the object(s) appeared to have had to be flying under their own power."],

We were watching fireworks that the neighbors were shooting off for the Fourth of July, so our eyes were on the sky. I noticed a very unusual &quot;firework&quot; that was higher than the low-flying clouds.  I pointed and asked my boyfriend (we are both over 50 and were not drinking)&quot;What the heck is THAT?!!&quot;  The object we both saw was coming from the east and headed in a straight line toward the west. It definitely looked man-made because it appeared to have flames on the bottom, but it was so high up that it could not have been a normal kind of fireworks.  The fact that we could detect flames even though it was so high up made us think the actual &quot;object&quot; had to be fairly large.  It traveled at a speed that was like if you watch the ISS go over or something like that except that it was much closer to earth than that (the ISS) or even satellites.  We have no idea what it was we saw, but neither of us had ever before seen anything like it.  My boyfriend has! been a novice astronomer for many years, fyi.  We weren&apos;t timing it but I am guessing it took a little over a minute before it faded out of view still flying on course.  There was a top on it above the flames, but it&apos;s been almost a month now and I honestly cannot remember well enough to describe the part above the flames.I was listening to George Noory last night and heard mention of the Fourth of July sightings.

After the fire works show it might have been around 22:30 or later, but all of a sudden two more lights that looked the same as the first, came from the south going north.In both cases there was no sound, no blinking lights that would indicate a human flying plane or helicopter, so I am sure it was UFO&rsquo;s!!!"],

        "description":["Slow-moving orb circles around houseAs it was the 4th of July, we were watching our neighbors set off some small fireworks around 9:00 pm, looking out the screen of our front door.  We did see a plane at one point, as well as a helicopter.  Then, seemingly appearing out of nowhere, my mother and I saw an orange-red orb flying towards our house.At first we thought it might be the lights on an airplane because it was flying so smoothly, but as it moved closer we speculated it might be a flare or firework of some kind.  However, it was moving slowly, and the light wasn&apos;t diminishing in intensity at all.  There was no trail behind it--it was an entirely self-contained light.  As it flew over our house, we both noticed smaller lights that seemed to be circling around the larger light.  The smaller lights, to me, looked to be pink and green in hue (among other colors.)  I only got a clear look at it for a couple of seconds.We ran to the back of the house, out onto our deck, and watched as it flew slowly over the pine trees and over the neighborhood behind us.  Again, it didn&apos;t explode or diminish as fireworks might. It made no sound whatsoever.We ran inside and downstairs to inform my father, then ran back upstairs to watch it circling around and taking a similar path over the house for a second time.  I ran to get my camera, but the battery was dead.  I hooked up the family camcorder quickly so that it was pulgged into the wall and not running on a battery, but it was behaving strangely and kept shutting off.  We watched as the object disappeared over the house a second time.  I went to charge the other camera while my parents watched the object take its route over the back of the house again.  My father initially suggested it might be a flare, and then admitted he had no idea what it really was.My mother and I are confident we saw something out of the ordinary.  It was the moment when it was almost directly above us and we saw the smaller lights around the object that conviced us this was no typical 4th of July experience."],

I am delaying this report because I am lazy and have been really busy lately.At approx. 22:30 hours, I was over at my friend&apos;s house in Mount Greenwood/Chicago celebrating the fourth of July.  My girlfriend, brother, friend and friends sister were in his pool in the backyard making a whirl pool when one of us, I don&apos;t remember who said &quot;WHATS THAT?!&quot;  We all stopped and looked EAST into the sky.  A ROUND almost flickering object (reddish/orange) was traveling from SOUTH TO NORTH across the sky.  I asked my friends girlfriend to quickly grab my glasses (because I was in the pool still).  My friend yelled for his two parents to come outside.We all watchedas the object just moved rather slowly across the sky...from south to north....I have been interested in UFO&apos;s/flying saucer phenomenon for quite sometime now, but never dreamed of actually being a witness.I payed close attention to this object....trying to listen for any noise or seeing any &quot;airplane lights,&quot; i.e. green, red, etc.  I could hear nothing.Now in a matter of seconds the object seemed to head Northeast away from our location.There were no fireworks in the sky at the moment so I ruled out that.  Did not appear to be a helicopter or airplane....the damn thing looked like it was on fire!   I thought it could be a military jet....but its lack of speed/being a weird bright flashy red / orange.....I COULD NOT EXPLAIN IT!  Hopefully someone else has seen it.My friend said later in the evening it appeared again and flew over his house.Scares the crap out of me!((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.

The date is July 4th 2010, time is approximately 22:00 hrs.  I was taking some long exposure photo&apos;s of the few fireworks the city of Womelsdorf budget allowed, not really looking at what it was that was happening in front of the lens.  I was just trying to keep the shutter open long enough to get a shot of the fire works over the cornfield, into the valley below.  My location is 40 degrees, 24&apos;,39 north x 76 degrees, 14&apos;,31 west.  Photo&apos;s that I have e-mailed to the director were shot at 173 degrees south to 132 degrees south south/east.  Upon viewing the photo&apos;s on the computer about an hour later, I came across some light formations in the sky on the photo&apos;s that none of the kids or my wife could remember seeing  during the short display of fireworks we witnessed.The long thin line with 12 red lights and 13 white lights running along the line show up in several photo&apos;s.  Some of the photo&apos;s have 2 (two) or 3(three) of these objects in them.  There are also some strange greenish/yellow swooshes accompanying these objects in some of the photo&apos;s.  There is also a red and a green linear light  below the large linear group of 12 red lights and 13 white lights.  All of these objects show up on the group of photo&apos;s in different locations around the area the fireworks were located.  There is even one photo where the objects are behind the fireworks.  These objects are definitely not a part of the fireworks, since they appear the same, with no change over the 15 to 20 sec. exposure time."],

(more north I think)  No other lights on the object that I could see.   Moving at speed of an airplane but no sound, no &ldquo;structure&rdquo; seen, no blinking/flashing lights and if I recall correctly it was just below the overcast/clouds it may have been &ldquo;reflecting a bit&rdquo; off of them.   It was definitely low in the sky at height of planes I often see going into O&rsquo;Hare.Time Lapse  Aprox 10-15 Secs.    Aprx. Time: 11pm well after fireworks.I was standing looking around in the sky at the stars, planes etc.  I had a set of binoculars around my neck (which I occasionally do now when observing the night sky).  This object caught my attention as I happened to be looking SW.  I kept looking with my bare eyes as it traveled closer towards me (initially dismissing it as probable helicopter or plane).When I still couldn&rsquo;t make it out, I took two steps forward , looked down to grab the binoculars and sit (so I could steady my hands) to get closer view&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;but, in the few seconds it took to look down, grab binocs and glance back up&hellip;while trying to feel for the chair&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;it disappeared.  No where to be found as I continued to pan the sky and recapture it.Now, I was with one other person who did NOT see the object because it disappeared before I made any comment about it.   Even though I was VERY curious about the object, I  kind of &ldquo;blew it off&rdquo;  thinking, no way this happens two years in a row, it must have been legit craft and went into the clouds when I diverted my gaze.2 Years in a row?  That&rsquo;s a weird part of this occurrence.  The same thing happened last year (and I reported it on this site then -you can view it there) July 4th 2009.  At about same time/diff trajectory.  But,  in 2009 the color and appearance was more like a Hazy Orange glowing basketball/orb- more definitively round with an entirely fuzzy glow emitting from the object itself.  Now-In 2010 the object was definitely Red and I don&rsquo;t think I would describe it as purely &ldquo;round&rdquo; NOR as having a &ldquo;hazy&rdquo; glow&hellip;&hellip;any ambient glow was more of a steady &ldquo;reflection off clouds&rdquo; this time.Sorry my facts aren&rsquo;t exact.  As mentioned, I wasn&rsquo;t going to post this as I find it rather odd that, (1) It happened on Independence Day when millions would likely be looking to the skies.  And (2) Similar events happen two years in a row?  This does not change what I saw &ndash; either year --without a doubt.  But, It makes me suspicious that somebody might be pulling off a big hoax/scam/trick somehow&hellip;.or, some manmade flying thing makes the same trip every year on the 4th?  There were many sightings last year too.I decided to post my observation after I went into your site to see, by chance, if anyone else saw what I saw and was surprised to see one other Streamwood, IL. report. Plus many others elsewhere.  I hope you can investigate this somehow to see if there is an &ldquo;earthly&rdquo; answer.  Next year on 4th maybe you can send out trained spotters in Midwest with good equipment?  Last comment:  I found the July 4th 2009 Orange Hazy Glowing Ball much more disturbing.((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.  PD))"],

It was traveling very fast, faster than commercial aircraft flying through the landing patterns to Greater Pittsburgh International Airport (which is a common occurrence in our neighborhood).  It was on a straight flight path the object stayed on the same path and did not divert from the path nor did it slow down or speed up - it remained constant.  Looking with naked eyes, the object appeared to be a very fast moving hot air ballon as it seemed to be glowing orange.  There was no sound that could be heard as it passed overhead.  It did not appear to have a wingspan or any type of other lights you would commonly see on commercial aircrafts.  The object passed over our group twice in the same exact pattern within a matter of 15-20 minutes.  I checked NASA&apos;s website for ISS viewings and there were none listed in our region for that night.  I don&apos;t know what it was but I believe ! with all of my rational being that it was not a manmade aircraft, a comet, a reflection, or a firework."],

We saw 3 separate sightings of similar UFO objects about 15 minutes apart-they were NOT an aircraft that anyone could identify-no flashing lights typical of aircraft, movements were not typical of planes, and no airplane noises were heard.The objects sight came from the horizon at the south-west (the first object came from a point furthest to the west compared to the other two) and traveled northerly up the lake pulsating a orangish/red glow. Their sizes at their largest point was about twice that of Venus, which was visible just above the western horizon and at least as bright if not brighter.  Each time, their altitudes were at least a few thousand feet (guessing-based on the height of the surrounding hills from the water).Most of their movements were similar in character to each other with erratic speed (fast then slow) and motions -veering off to one side or the other, sometimes instantly reversing their direction - sometimes appearing to stop or hover along their mainly northern route before continuing. None of the movements were super-fast.All three sightings ended similarly in that they appeared to stop in about the same location to our south (distance unknown and very difficult to even guess) although their routes to get to that area were slightly different.  After being stationary a few seconds-they got brighter and brighter then began to move south and upward slowly (in relation to our position) as their light dimmed and then vanished.  The second object re-appeared briefly (and dully) after a second or so of turning south disappearing, remaining visible for one or two more seconds again - which helped to verify that it was still moving after we lost sight of it before it then vanished.The first sighting was approximately 5-6 minutes long, with the second and third being a little over 4 minutes."],

        "description":["Saw unknown persistent light in the sky and then a gray object that arced away when the light stopped.I was out birding Saturday evening at Valley View Preserve.  It was about 935pm.  There were scattered fireworks going off to the south and the northeast but I think it was still a little too light out for people to start setting things off in earnest.  The sky was clear or had a few clouds.  I was looking at and scanning the tree line with binoculars for perched owls when I saw this persistent orange-yellow light in the sky south or southwest hovering in the same spot at maybe 45-50 degrees above the horizon and not flickering.  The light was maybe 2 or 3 times larger than Venus in the sky and certainly way smaller than the moon.  I had no idea what it was but eventually figured it was either a) some kind of firework b) the back of a distant plane/jet or maybe c)the launch of some kind of rocket or something since the last weird thing I saw in the sky, that was kind of similar to this event, was part of an NSA Atlas rocket launch.After a few minutes of shining in exactly the same spot in the sky, the light stopped and I saw this gray, blurry object slowly arc a very short distance east from where the light had been until it faded away or I just lost track of it in the increasing darkness.  The gray object, which I figured was the emitter of the light, was roughly the same size as the light or maybe slightly smaller and possibly top-like in shape.  I watched the whole sequence with and without binoculars but don&apos;t recall the binoculars giving me a much better view of the event except that they more clearly revealed a non-flickering light.  The light was shining for a few minutes and I saw the gray object for probably less than 30 seconds.I don&apos;t know what it actually was but still think it could have been one of the things I thought it might be.  If it was a firework, I&apos;ve never seen anything exactly like it before.  The light looked sort of like a Roman candle if there was just one flare, no smoke trail and the flare stayed in one spot in the sky instead of moving in an arc.  If it was a plane, there should have been blinking lights on the object after the light, it should have moved in a more direct way and I should have heard some sort of sound.  I don&apos;t recall hearing any sounds that I could attribute to the light/object.  And if it was some sort of rocket, it didn&apos;t seem to leave Earth&apos;s atmosphere and was a little different than what I saw before.I had actually completely forgotten about this until Peter Davenport appeared on Coast to Coast AM and am submitting this report per his request.  And I&apos;m not looking at any of the other reports until I submit mine."],

It is several acres of park ground with an outdoor stage for concerts, etc. We were seated in lawn chairs on the west side of the park/stage area.  A few feet to the west of us is a street, on the other side of which is Addison Airport for small planes.  As part of the festivities there were flyovers by vintage war airplanes, circling the park area.  The wind section of the symphony was playing music on the stage as the vintage planes occasionally circled the park.  Our chairs were facing the stage, a few yards to our southeast, with the airport behind us.  I do not know the time, but it was still light, approximately 8- 8:30 pm.I happened to notice and began to watch something bright orange, somewhat circular in shape, approaching from the behind the stage (from the south) travelling in a straight line to the northwest, crossing over the Addison airport.I pointed it out to my friend and we both watched as a 2nd object appeared behind the first one.  The two objects flew silently in a straight line from south to northwest.  There was nothing unusual about the flight pattern, only that they were bright orange and that I had never seen anything of that color before, and that they were somewhat circular in shape.The vintage planes had been flying at a lower altitude where you could clearly see their shape.  The two orange objects were a lot higher in the sky, but low enough to appear an approximate 4 inch diameter as we viewed it.  They moved quickly.  Our line of sight was about a mile, and it took a couple of minutes for them to disappear from view.We both watched and commented about it. I made a joke that maybe it was ufo&rsquo;s for our 4th of July festivities. They were definitely not airplanes as we know them.I have never seen any kind of ufo before and I didn&rsquo;t think any more about it until I heard your report on Coast to Coast that there were many such sightings on July 4, and I mentally noted that we had seen these objects on July 3, but at a July 4 celebration.There were several hundred people at the event, but I only know of my friend and I who actually watched these 2 objects."],

The sky was clear, with stars, satellites and aircraft visible.  A dull orange colored orb suddenly &quot;switched on&quot; about 30 degrees above the southern horizon.  It was large in comparison to the stars and planets, I would estimate it was the size of a pea at arm&apos;s length.  It was moving quickly in an arc heading towards the northeast, faster than any of the aircraft that were visible but too slow to be a meteor.  The orb had an appearance similar to a circular charcoal briquet, with the center slightly flickering as it moved.  It was not very bright at all, as a landing light on a plane would be, and its circular shape was sharply defined. It did not leave a trail of any type or make any sound.  I watched it until it disappeared behind the roof of my house.  I ran to the front yard, but was unable to locate it again.  I cannot say how high it might have been except that it did not seem to be as high as a satellite.

We were cresting a hill when I saw a strange bright orange/yellow glittering ball of light overhead just above the pine trees, high in the sky.  It was very bright, as bright as a planet I would say.  Certainly not as bright as an airplane might be.  The strange light moved away at a steady slow rate and we lost it.  We walked for minute more and then suddenly we saw it again!   It was coming back in the opposite direction!  We were so stunned by this we stopped to look at it and we definitely though this light was odd. It was glittering, bright orange and sometimes reddish in tint.  We just stood there and watched it move silently, and slowly.  It&apos;s flight was somewhat wobbly, even though it moved in a straight trajectory.  After about a minute it became very dim, only a pinprick of light and then it vanished completely.  Whatever it was, my sister was overjoyed she&apos;d seen a ufo but I on the other hand was pretty shaken up.  I&apos;ve never seen anything like that before!"],

I started telling everyone there, mostly family, to look at this thing.  I pointed and said &quot;what is that?&quot;  Of course nobody had an answer and we just watched it burning up the atmosphere.

        "description":["Red, circular object sighted in night sky before fireworks displayOn the night of Saturday July 3, 2010, myself, my husband, sister, and young son attended the Waynesboro Fireworks display.  The fireworks are set off in a field located behind and to the left ( if you are facing the front of the school) of the local high school, and to the right of the middle school and were slated to start at 9:30 PM, but in the end were not set of until around 9:45.  My family and I decided to take seat in the field which is across the street located in front of the high school to view the evenings display.  There were many people around us.  Just to include some background info, they had already set of several &quot;test&quot; fireworks at around 9:15 PM.  Again these fireworks, when viewed from our orientation, were located behind and to the left of the high school.As we were waiting for the display to begin, at around 9:25, I was looking at the sky and noticed a red, circular object, with a kind of haze around the outside edges.  It lined up with the left corner of the high school, however much farther south than the school was, and was just floating there.  I alerted my husband and sister to the object (my son is 2 and took no interest), and it began to move in an east to west direction, but could also have been moving away in an east to south-west direction.  From our viewpoint it seemed to travel the length of the school (east to west).  It was also slowly climbing in altitude, which quickly made us realize this was not a flare.  The object also seemed to be pulsating, as in the light would grow smaller, get bigger, and grow smaller again,but was not blinking.  Once it reached about the middle of the high school, as it was climbing very slowly in altitude it began to disappear. It would flicker out, then reappear and flicker out.  It did this very slowly.  Eventually, it either shrunk and disappeared or flew so far that the light was no longer visible.  This object was visible for between one and two minutes.   I have tried to calculate the distance away and altitude just now, but find it hard to triangulate it without going back to the site and using proper tools, less I give and improper estimate.After viewing the object, we were all puzzled as to what it could be.  There were people behind us whom I know noticed it, and were confused also because I heard them saying, &quot;What in the world is that?&quot;  We did not discuss the matter with them, however.  This object was in no way a plane, helicopter, flare, or firework.  It moved too slowly to be a plane or helicopter, and was like no fire work I have ever seen.  It also did not originate from the area where the fireworks were being set off at, and it went in a direction against the wind.  I am able to remember this because the fireworks were being blown toward us to the north, and the object was moving to the west. The object seemed to just appear all the sudden, also. I would have though it was possibly a flare, being happy to arrive at a known solution; however it traveled in a direction, and lasted an amount of time uncommon for a flare.  Usually a flare will still be lit after it travels upward and begins to fall to the ground.This object at no time fell in altitude, it rose. I have seen flares before, and this was not a flare.  I am at a loss as to what this object was, and it has bothered me since.  I hope this report was of service, and if there are any further questions, feel free to contact me."],

It appeared quite low to the ground with a yellow center and a red flame type appearance surrounding it.   As I was in town, I first saw it in a block where there were no buildings and then twice more when looking down the alleys as I drove by.   I was then in a turn lane and forced to turn north, away from the object.   It was a clear day with little to no clouds.  The time in this report is approximate.   I went back to try to locate it again.  However, the way the town is set up, I had to go quite a way around to return to where I saw the object and it was gone when I returned.   I had planned on attempting to get a photo of the object but was unable to do so as I could no longer catch sight of it."],

The second light caught up to the first one and they joined together.   The one light started flying east and higher in the sky.

Object stopped in the distance then returned to original location when fireworks resumed.Remarks: My son another, and myself were watching the fireworks display when my son pointed out an object that appeared to be hovering in the air. I looked up at it and it was unusual in both color and shape. The ambient noise made it impossible to determine if there was any associated engine noise, but the object was indeed unusual. For the time that we observed it, it moved several times. The impression was that it was demonstrating an interest in the fire works, and we discussed the possibility of it being a helicopter or balloon/dirigible observing the firework display.  My son pointed out that the lighting was not correct for either.  Upon conclusion of the firework display, the object traveled quite fast to the east where we lost sight of it.  We then walked over to a local dinner approximately a 15-minute walk.  Before entering the dinner, I looked back in the direction of where the object had been and it had returned.  This coincided with the start of another towns&rsquo; commencing of! a fireworks display.Several weeks later, I check with the Parks Department of Red Bank for any information concerning the possible photographing of the fireworks display from an airborne platform.  The individual that I spoke with was unaware of any photo operation.  The location of the event is several miles from a naval weapons station, so I guess the possibility exists that it might have been some security operation."],

I have four bats that come out at night and was watching them eating insects.  Something caught my eye and it looked like it might be a half mile up in the sky.The object was not exactly oval shaped, but not really cigar shaped, but rather like a capsule. The back half was lit, but not with a light bulb.  The middle section was dark, and the front was identical to the back half lit, more glowing.  There was no sound, no wings, no gondola, and it appeared to be moving as if by equipment, and not the wind.I watched for approximately 4 minutes.  This object was going from approximately north to south. It disappeared by just going away in the distance. Also, it the light was not brought on by the sunset, as the sun was already down for the night.To give an estimate of how large this object may have been if on the ground it is hard to say, but my estimate would probably be in the 25-30 feet range, the height maybe 8 feet or so.  My neighbor asked me, when I told him of this, wanted to know if there were any smaller lights on it, such as what airplanes use, and there were not."],

        "description":["Groups of bright orange/amber lights in the evening sky July 3, 2010On Saturday, July 3, my mother and I had been watching the local lake association&apos;s fireworks display from the comfort of our living room.  Our west window had a perfect view of the fireworks that were launched over the lake.  After the &quot;grand finale&quot; at about 10:40, I got up to put the dog outside one last time for the night, and went our our back door.  I looked up towards the western sky and saw several pairs of bright orange lights moving from the WSW horizon (roughly the &quot;8:00&quot; position) in a NNE direction.  The lights were each at least as bright as Venus, which was still visible in the western sky at that time.  They just immediately struck me as very odd due to the orange color -- had they been the traditional white/yellow light of airplanes, I would have just assumed it was a group of planes traveling together in some sort of formation.I immediately called out to my mother &quot;Quick, look out the west window, there are UFO&apos;s in the sky&quot; -- only half jokingly, because the lights were just so wierd.  At the very same time, my mother was calling out to me &quot;What are those lights?&quot;  They struck her as very odd, too, her comment was &quot;are we being invaded?&quot;  I went outside to get a better look.  Over the next roughly 10 minutes, there were probably a total of 8 to 9 pairs of these orange lights, traveling from the 8:00 position on the western horizon to the area of the Big Dipper constellation, which was in the northwestern sky perhaps 3/4ths of the way up from the horizon.  The lights appeared on the horizon generally about every 60 to 90 seconds, and at most times there were probably 2 sets of them visible in the sky.  It took each pair of lights perhaps one and a half to two minutes to move that distance -- they appeared to be rather slow-moving.When the lights got quite high in the sky, most of the way towards the region of the Big Dipper, the lights dimmed and then finally went out entirely and the objects were no longer visible.At perhaps 10:50, about 10 minutes after the first objects appeared, there were no more to be seen, and I thought they were gone. After about 5 minutes, another 3 or 4 pairs of objects appeared following the exact same trajectory.  The last of these disappeared and I waited another 2 or 3 minutes and went inside -- I noted it was 11:03 pm when I came inside at that point.I have no idea how high or how far away these objects were.  When the lights first appeared, I should also note that I could see at least 3 planes in the sky in the same general region of the sky as these lights.  One of the planes was very low, with a single white light and moving from SE to NW, possibly to make an approach to Oakland Pontiac International Airport about 3 or 4 miles to the nother.  The other two planes were probably commercial passenger jets -- higher up, and flashing white, red, and green lights, one traveling from the NW to the SE, the other very high and traveling almost due west to due east.The unknown orange objects may have been low enough to be at the altitudes that small private planes fly at, or, for all I know, they may have been in orbit.  I should note that it was a very clear night, and even at that late hour there was still a glow of twilight on the western horizon, so it&apos;s possible, I guess, that if these were objects in orbit the light may have been the last rays of the sunlight bouncing off the objects.  I have seen the space shuttle in the International Space Station before, and those actually move in a similar manner to these unknown objects, but on those, when I saw them, the light was a very yellow light similar to Venus, not orange.  So, still kind of odd in my opinion.I couldn&apos;t detect any noise from the objects, but as I said, I have no idea how far away from them I was, and also, it was a very noisy night, with a lot of fireworks and firecrackers still going off, and a noisy party somewhere a street or two over with rock music playing on a p.a. system and people laughging and hollering.I find it hard to believe that a lot of people would not have seen these objects.  Since it was Saturday July 3rd, a great number of people were having parties and get-togethers, and it was a perfect, warm, clear, beautiful evening, and there was a lot of activity in the area, a lot of cars on the road, and so forth.  Since over 1.2 million people live in Oakland County, Michigan, I find it really hard to believe that a lot of people wouldn&apos;t have seen these lights, and I find it even harder to believe that they wouldn&apos;t have struck others as odd, too.I truly don&apos;t have a clue what these objects may have been -- some kind of squadron of old planes or ultralites traveling to an air show?  Military planes?  Had the lights been white/yellow, I would have thought so. I did ask my brother-in-law, who was a cargo pilot in the airforce during the Vietnam era, and who still is a private pilot, and he stated that planes would only have white/yellow lights, plus the blinking red and green wing lights on larger planes, but I suppose even he could be wrong.  Satelites?  Any that I&apos;ve seen reflecting the sunlight were a more white/yellow light as well.  So, what they were, I truly don&apos;t know.  I just know I haven&apos;t seen anything that color before moving like a plane moves, and definitely not in pairs and groups.  I carefully watched the local news that night and for the next few days, checked the local papers, and looked online, because I thought this might be a newsworthy event, or at least someone might offer an explanation of these lights.  Since then, I&apos;ve done a lot of searching online, and I haven&apos;t found any references to this event.  It still baffles me because the lights were just such an odd color of orange, so unlike any aircraft I&apos;ve seen."],

From a dock on the Connecticut shore a friend and I (60&apos;s, college educated, non-profit professionals) were looking up at the stars about 9 p.m. as the twilight was disappearing and the sky was becoming increasingly dark.  We were both looking  at about &quot;10-10:30 o&rsquo;clock&quot; out over Long Island Sound and simultaneously we caught sight of a very fast moving light that blinked and zigzagged and then disappeared.  It was probably in our visual field for no more than 3 seconds.  It was quite out of the ordinary and we both commented on it at the same time.While similar in brightness to a high flying airplane or satellite, it didn&rsquo;t resemble any airplane or satellite I&rsquo;ve seen before.  And neither of us thought it was a shooting star.  I&rsquo;ve never seen an airplane or satellite or shooting star zigzag like this object did.  Because it moved in a fast, but measured, geometric pattern it seemed much more like a mechanical object than a natural phenomenon like a comet or shooting star.

The distance between the show and the orb was at least &frac12; mile when we spotted it.  (Judged buy the distance across the bay.)  After the first light passed into the tree line, completely opposite direction of the show, another orb of light came from the horizon behind the fireworks.  It also passed in the opposite direction of the display.Then on July 6th, at apx. 11:PM, my daughter and I saw the same type of light while sitting on our porch; apx. 5-7 miles from the area of the fireworks show on the 3rd.All three orbs were deep yellow to orange in color.  Their luminosity was steady, no pulsation, no fireball or comet-tail appearance.They passed at about the speed of an ultralite, from one horizon to the other.I&rsquo;m judging their height above the ground to be roughly the altitude a search plane might fly.

However, I beg to differ because this ring shaped object was PERFECTLY round. Also the ring was moving at a very fast pace. The wind was very very still at the time.  Since this occurance I am interested in&amp;#65279; what it was or may be.  Like I said before, I did strongly not believe in Aliens/UFO&apos;s.  But this time I was very quick to doubt it was smoke from the fireworks. The reason being is when someone makes a ring of smoke with their cigarette the ring will gradually get bigger and rise.  Whereas this CLOUDY like ring was moving across the sky."],

Then i focused my eyes and got a better look it was slowly moving and then stopped.  I then ran inside got my wife it was a bright glowing orange color.   After about a minute it was hovering over top of the house and the orange glow was gone.  You could clearly see a disk and from the distance away it was about the size of a childs soccor ball.

        "description":["Four red-orange spherical objects crossed the sky one after another on July 3rdI witnessed a red-orange spherical object that did not appear to be an airplane or a meteorite.  It crossed the sky slowly, taking approximately one minute until it went out of site.  Shortly after it disappeared another one started from the same place the first one started. In total there were four objects over the course of approximately four minutes, all one after the other in the exact same path.  It crossed the sky in a similar speed or fashion to an airplane, however there were not any blinking lights or white lights.  Airplanes are a very common site where I live, and this was no airplane.  There were three other adult witnesses sitting with me on the deck.  It was very bizarre, as it looked like a giant roman candle shooting slowly across the sky, but it would have been impossible for it to have been a firework, due to the fact that it crossed several miles of sky with no sound.((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.
